			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">[Jony Ive] has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me. There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That’s the way I set it up.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—STEVE JOBS</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Steve Jobs had surgery for a pancreatic tumor in July 2004. As he was recovering from his first bout with cancer, he asked to see two people. One was his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs; the other was Jony Ive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After nearly eight years of working together almost daily, Jony and Jobs had a special and intimate relationship. The pair had been nearly inseparable, attending many of the same meetings, eating lunch together and spending afternoons at the studio going over future projects.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs’s first surgery didn’t fully cure him and he later underwent a second round of surgery, taking a leave of absence from Apple to undergo a liver transplant in Memphis, Tennessee, in May 2009. Jobs flew home on his private jet with his wife, where he was met by Jony and Tim Cook at San Jose Airport. The question of Apple’s future was very much in the air, as the announcement of Jobs’s leave had led many in the press to predict that Apple was doomed without him. It seemed to be the consensus of the punditocracy that the fate of Apple rested solely on Jobs’s shoulders.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony drove Jobs home from the airport and confided on the journey that he was disturbed by newspaper opinion pieces that staked Apple’s survival to Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_252"></a>“I’m really hurt,” Jony told Jobs. He was worried about Jobs’s health, and the health of the company they both loved. As Jony told Jobs’s biographer Walter Isaacson, the perception that Jobs was the engine of Apple’s innovation was damaging, he said. “That makes us vulnerable as a company,” Jony said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber350"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber350" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That Jony’s ego wasn’t always sublimated to Jobs’s and to Apple is hardly surprising. On another occasion, Jony also complained about Jobs’s habit of stealing his ideas. “He will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, ‘That’s no good. That’s not very good. I like that one,’” Jony told Isaacson. “And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea. I pay maniacal attention to where an idea comes from, and I even keep notebooks filled with my ideas. So it hurts when he takes credit for one of my designs.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber351"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber351" class="calibre2">2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nonetheless, Jony acknowledged, he could have never accomplished what he has without Jobs. “In so many other companies, ideas and great design get lost in the process,” he said. “The ideas that come from me and my team would have been completely irrelevant, nowhere, if Steve hadn’t been here to push us, work with us and drive through all the resistance to turn our ideas into products.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber352"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber352" class="calibre2">3</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During 2011, with Jobs on leave that, in the end, proved to be his last, a rash of news stories claimed that Jony was threatening to leave Apple at the end of a three-year stock deal. Jony and his wife reportedly wanted their twin boys to be educated in Britain. The UK newspaper the <em class="calibre3">Guardian</em> published a story about Jony’s impending departure, giving it the headline “Apple’s Worst Nightmare”<a id="SuperscriptNumber353"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber353" class="calibre2">4</a></sup>; London’s <em class="calibre3">Sunday Times</em> ran a feature saying that Jony was “at loggerheads” with Apple over his desire to move from Cupertino back to Britain, where he owned a home in Somerset. One story suggested Jony would commute between Britain and California.<a id="SuperscriptNumber354"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber354" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre3">Threatening</em> was probably the right word; Jony didn’t quit. According <a id="pageMap_253"></a>to an unnamed friend quoted in the British newspaper article, Jony was “just too valuable to Apple and they told him in no uncertain terms that if he headed back to England he would not be able to sustain his position with them.” To cement his connection with Apple, the company reportedly paid Jony a $30 million bonus and offered him shares worth a further $25 million. At the time, Jony’s personal fortune was estimated at $130 million.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In retrospect, the facts suggest Jony had no intention of moving. He sold a mansion he owned in Somerset close to his parents because he wasn’t using it. Jony appeared more committed to Apple than ever.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony regularly gets calls from other companies and headhunters, offering him lucrative opportunities to design everything from cars to shoes. But he’s emphatically said no to the question of whether he would leave Apple. “The thing is, you could transplant me and this design group to another place and we wouldn’t work at all,” he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber355"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber355" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">On August 24, 2011, Apple announced that Steve Jobs was resigning as CEO, but would remain with the company as chairman of the board. Tim Cook officially took over the day-to-day running of the company.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The news shouldn’t have been a surprise but it was. Jobs had been on medical leave since January, and he was obviously a very sick man, appearing emaciated during his few public appearances that year. Even in the face of such a harsh reality, however, everyone found it difficult to imagine an Apple without Steve Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Many pundits weighed in, arguing that Jony should take over. He had a public profile (Cook did not) because of all the promotional videos he’d appeared in and the awards he’d scooped up. But few serious Apple observers pegged him as the next CEO—not even Jony himself. As one former member of his design team said of Jony’s attitude toward being CEO, “Jony doesn’t care about all those aspects of running a <a id="pageMap_254"></a>company.” Explaining that Jony had no interest in the business side of Apple—just as he had hated the business side at Tangerine—the designer concluded, “He just wants to focus on ID.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“All I’ve ever wanted to do is design and make; it’s what I love doing,” Jony told one interviewer. “It’s great if you can find what you love to do. Finding it is one thing but then to be able to practise that and be preoccupied with that is another.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber356"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber356" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the master of Apple’s global supply chain, Tim Cook was, in fact, much the logical successor. In just thirteen years, Cook had constructed a complex apparatus that allowed the company to build superb gadgets—albeit of Jony’s design—at unparalleled speed, volume, efficiency and profitability. Cook might not possess Jobs’s charisma, but he was a logistics titan who had been effectively running the company ever since Jobs had gone on his most recent medical leave. He also had experience, serving as interim CEO during Jobs’s absences in 2004 and 2009. According to Apple insiders interviewed for this book, Cook is generally affable, a consensus player who wants everyone to buy in, which makes him easier to work with than willful personalities like Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs died just over a month after his resignation, on October 5, 2011. The man who once said in a speech at Stanford University that “death is very likely the single best invention of life” was about to be eulogized at just fifty-six. His funeral two days later in Alta Mesa was attended by just four of his colleagues from Apple: vice presidents Eddy Cue (software) and Katie Cotton (communications), CEO Cook and Jony. The memorial service held for Jobs at Stanford University ten days after that, though still private, drew former U.S. president Bill Clinton, former vice president Al Gore, Bill Gates, Google CEO Larry Page, U2 frontman Bono and News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch. Jony had a chance to publicly mourn his mentor and friend three weeks after Jobs’s death. At <a id="pageMap_255"></a>a staff memorial service held on Apple’s Cupertino campus, Jony gave the most heartfelt (and humorous) speech of the day, filling his eight-minute tribute to Steve—his “best and most loyal friend”—with personal anecdotes. By turns Jony was funny, touching and insightful, as he described Steve’s passion and enthusiasm, his sense of humor and his great joy in doing things right.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s eulogy started with an aside. “Steve used to say to me a lot, ‘Hey Jony, here’s a really dopey idea.’ And sometimes they were really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony remembered that Jobs “constantly questioned, ‘Is this good enough? Is this right?’” He saw Jobs’s great triumph as “the celebration of making something great for everybody, enjoying the defeat of cynicism . . . the rejection of being told a hundred times, ‘You can’t do that.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony closed by telling the massed Apple employees at the memorial, “We worked together for nearly fifteen years—and he still laughed at the way I said ‘aluminium.’ For the last two weeks, we’ve all been struggling to find ways to say good-bye. This morning, I simply want to end by saying, ‘Thank you, Steve. Thank you for your remarkable vision which has united and inspired this extraordinary group of people—for all that we have learned from you and for all that we will continue to learn from each other, thank you Steve.’”</p>
