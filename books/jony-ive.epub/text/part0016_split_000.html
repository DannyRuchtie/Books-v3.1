			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title">Unibody Everywhere</h1>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">From a design and engineering point of view, Apple is at the absolute pinnacle of creating products that are as close to flawless as can be done.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—DENNIS BOYLE, COFOUNDER, IDEO</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">In 2008, Jony took the stage at an Apple event to talk about something special: Apple’s new “unibody” manufacturing process. His very appearance was a clear sign from the company of the importance of this design breakthrough.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony began by talking about the old MacBook Pro, which was one of the lightest and strongest laptops on the market at the time. Its robust strength resulted from a complex structure of internal frames and strengthening plates screwed and welded together. As Jony spoke, a series of slides played behind him, showing the multiple parts layered, bonded and finally mated with a plastic gasket that ran around the middle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“For years,” Jony told the audience, “we have been looking for a better way to make a notebook.” He paused and smiled before continuing. “And we think we found it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber337"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber337" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony went on to explain the manufacture of the MacBook Air, Apple’s new razor-thin laptop. Instead of taking multiple sheets of metal and layering them, the new process began with a thick block of metal and, in a reversal of the old process, produced a frame by removing material rather than by adding it. Multiple parts were replaced by just one—hence the name unibody.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_241"></a>Jony’s slides illustrated the various stages. Pronouncing aluminum the British way (aloo-min-ium), he said, while smiling: “One of the fantastic things about aluminum is how recyclable it is. So at each of these distinct stages, we are continually collecting the material, and cleaning it and then recycling it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber338"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber338" class="calibre2">2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although he revealed none of the most essential secrets of the process, he clearly reveled in its fantastic, robot-controlled production. “We started with a solid slab of aluminum, high grade aluminum, that weighed over 2.5 lbs and we end with this remarkably precise part that now only weighs a quarter of a pound. And it’s not only incredibly light, it’s very, very strong.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The process represented the realization of something else close to Jony’s design soul. By melding great design with state-of-the-art manufacturing technology, Apple had produced something remarkable and new. “That one part,” continued Jony, “just that single part, forms the structure for the MacBook Air. It really is this highly precise aluminum unibody enclosure that made this product possible.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At that moment, the MacBook Air was the only Apple machine made with the unibody process. However, Apple was about to move almost all of its major products, including the Mac, iPhone and iPad, to unibody.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The change would be a watershed, albeit one that in the excitement surrounding the launch of various products, went largely unacknowledged by the public.</p>
