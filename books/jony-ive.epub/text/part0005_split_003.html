			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">At sixteen, Jony’s talent was already beginning to gain the attention of the design world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Philip J. Gray, the managing director of London’s leading design firm, Roberts Weaver Group, spotted Jony’s work at a teachers’ conference.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Her Majesty’s chief inspector for design, Mike Ive organized what became an annual conference to promote design in the national curriculum. When Phil Gray arrived to be the event’s keynote speaker, he laid eyes on Jony’s work for the first time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the conference foyer a small exhibition of design work by high school students had been installed. Among the work on display were some pieces by Jony. Gray was drawn immediately to Jony’s sketches of toothbrushes. Much later, Gray recalled the “fine lines in pencil and crayon,” and “the quality of thinking and analysis” evident in the work of the young design student.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“His work stood out as being very mature for a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old,” Gray said. “I remarked what an extraordinary talent. Mike replied, ‘That’s nice because that was done by my son Jony.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber17"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber17" class="calibre2">18</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few days later, father and son visited Gray at the Roberts Weaver Group offices in central London. Over lunch, Gray gave the Ives some <a id="pageMap_11"></a>advice about the best colleges for ID. “I made a few recommendations,” Gray recalled. His top recommendation was Newcastle Polytechnic.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During lunch, Mike Ive also asked a cheeky question: Would Gray’s company sponsor Jony though college? In return for an annual stipend (about £1,500 for each of four years), Jony would promise to work for the design firm after graduation. Sponsoring was very unusual at the time, but Gray agreed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony is the only person I sponsored at RWG,” Gray said. “We had interns, who came to work with us during summer breaks from university—but Jony was the only student we sponsored. . . . I had no problem persuading the other directors at RWG to sponsor Jony, because he had shown some clear talent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although it might appear that Mike Ive was driving his son to pursue a career in design, Gray didn’t believe that was the case. He thought Mike was just responding to his son’s growing obsession with design. “Mike used his position to be able to rub shoulders with the design elite and he hoped that some of that would rub off on Jony,” Gray allowed, adding that Jony “was a very smart engineer. . . . Father and son were both very enthusiastic. A liking for design was just in the family.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber18"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber18" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the years that followed, Gray had more opportunities to observe father and son. “They were so alike; shy but very focused and [they] always got things done without fuss,” he said. “I never recall raised voices! My memories are mostly of smiles and the pleasure of being with them rather than raucous laughter. Mike’s pride was there to see but never spoken about. It’s unusual but talent and modesty can go together.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His father’s influence was evident in Jony’s temperament as well as in their shared love of design. “Mike Ive was a real enthusiast who always loved what he did,” said Gray. “He was a really energetic person and desperately keen for his son to succeed. He was simply a caring <a id="pageMap_12"></a>father who tried to make sure that Jony had all the best opportunities to get on as a designer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In his years at Walton High School, Jony opted to study not only design technology at an advanced level but also chemistry and physics, which was unusual for an arts-oriented student. When he graduated from Walton High School in 1985, he did so with an A in each of his three A-level exams. The hard work of two years of preparation paid off, as earning three top grades wasn’t easy: According to UK government statistics, his results put him in the top 12 percent of students nationwide.<a id="SuperscriptNumber19"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber19" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These grades made him eligible to apply for Oxford or Cambridge, the best known of the UK universities. Having been interested in studying to be a car designer, he also considered Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in London, one of the world’s leading art and design schools. But when he visited, the place didn’t seem to be a good fit. Jony found the other students “too weird,” as he put it. “They were making ‘vroom, vroom’ noises as they did their drawings.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber20"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber20" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With his academic record and evident talents, Jony had choices. In the end, he did as Phil Gray had advised and opted for Newcastle Polytechnic in the north of England. Product design was to be his main thing.</p>
