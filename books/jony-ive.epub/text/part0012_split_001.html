<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">“In Your Pocket”</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">As Rubinstein remembers, his biggest initial problem was that everybody at Apple, including Jony’s ID group, was already busy with other products. As was usual with such exploratory, blue-sky projects, Apple went looking for an outside consultant.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Someone recommended Tony Fadell, a designer/engineer who specialized in handheld hardware and digital audio. Fadell had worked for General Magic, an Apple spinoff, and developed PDAs for Philips before launching his own start-up, Fuse Networks, in the late 1990s.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fadell’s twelve-person firm was busy trying to build an MP3 stereo player, a conventional rack-mounted component with a hard drive and CD reader instead of a tape deck or FM radio. Fadell had shopped his idea around without much success, approaching the Swiss watch giant Swatch and Palm Inc. His conversations with Real Networks brought him to Rubinstein’s attention.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_175"></a>Rubinstein phoned Fadell on a ski slope in Aspen, Colorado, and asked him to come in and talk about a project. It was so secret, Rubinstein told him, I can’t tell you what it is. Because it was Apple calling, Fadell agreed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Only after Fadell signed a confidentiality contract did Rubinstein tell him about iTunes and their desire to build an MP3 player to hook into it. Fadell wasn’t particularly enthusiastic—Apple hadn’t been exactly hot in 2000—but he was flat broke. He’d burned through his start-up’s cash and, because the dot-com bubble had burst, he couldn’t raise any more money. Fadell took the job just so he could pay his team at Fuse.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rubinstein offered Fadell an eight-week contract to analyze what it would take to build an MP3 player. He had to figure out the battery, screen, chips and other components, plus what kind of team would be required to get it made. When he was done, a feasibility study would be reported to Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fadell was assigned an internal contact, hardware marketing manager Stan Ng. The two quickly formulated the design story for the new product. “‘In your pocket’ became the mantra for the product, because that was definitely the size and form factor that hit the sweet spot,” Ng said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber251"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber251" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fadell identified potential components, mostly from the cell phone industry, which was then rapidly taking off. Based on the size of the components he was looking at, he made mock-ups from glued-together Foam Core. A design emerged: a simple rectangle, about the size of a cigarette pack. Since it felt too light in his hand, he gave it heft by adding some old fishing weights he found in his garage. He flattened them with a hammer, then slid them between the model’s foam boards.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rubinstein loved the model and, in early April, Fadell and Ng presented it to Steve Jobs and other members of the executive team, including Rubinstein, Robbin and Schiller. Fadell hadn’t met Jobs <a id="pageMap_176"></a>before, but he’d been coached on how to make sure Jobs picked the right design: Present three options and save the best for last. Fadell had made drawings of the first two mock-ups and brought along his Foam Core model, which he hid under a large wooden bowl that was kept on the long table in the fourth-floor executive conference room.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ng opened with some slides about the music market and current MP3 players, but a bored Jobs kept interrupting. Fadell took over. He laid all the potential parts on the table, including Toshiba’s 1.8-inch hard drive, a small piece of glass for the screen, various battery alternatives, a sample motherboard. He began talking about pricing curves of memory and hard drive storage, battery technologies and the different kinds of displays.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then he stood up and showed the meeting a picture of his first concept, which was a big brick of a device with a slot for removable storage. Jobs said it was too complicated.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next drawing was smaller and held thousands of songs, but it was based on volatile flash memory that would be wiped clean if the battery died. Jobs didn’t like that either, so Fadell went to the table, grabbed all the parts he’d shown earlier, and began snapping them together, like a LEGO model. He handed the electronic sandwich to Jobs. As Jobs turned it over in his hands, Fadell lifted the bowl and gave him the more finished prototype.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs was enthusiastic. Then Phil Schiller surprised everyone when he left the room and returned with several models for an MP3 player that featured a scroll wheel. Schiller explained that a wheel was the best way to navigate quickly through any list, whether of names and addresses or songs. The more you turned the wheel, he explained, the faster the list would scroll, making it quick to get to the bottom of a very long list. He pointed out that to select something, you hit the bull’s-eye in the middle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Schiller had gotten the idea in a meeting where he’d been examining <a id="pageMap_177"></a>competing MP3 players. He’d been irritated by having to hit a tiny button hundreds of times to go up and down a menu one song at a time. “You can’t hit the Plus button a thousand times!” he said. “So I figured, if you can’t go up, why not go around?”<a id="SuperscriptNumber252"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber252" class="calibre2">2</a></sup> He found that scroll wheels were actually fairly common in electronics, from scrolling mice to Palm thumb wheels. Bang &amp; Olufsen BeoCom phones had a dial for navigating lists of phone contacts and calls that resembled the one that eventually became a signature element in the iPod’s design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs asked Fadell if he could build Schiller’s scroll wheel. Fadell said yes, of course. The project was code-named P-68.</p>
