			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">One morning in the fall of 2006, Jobs gathered the iPhone leaders in Apple’s boardroom to talk about the state of iPhone development. Fred Vogelstein of <em class="calibre3">Wired</em> described the scene as a horror show of bad news.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was clear that the prototype was still a disaster. It wasn’t just buggy, it flat-out didn’t work. The phone dropped calls constantly, the battery stopped charging before it was full, data and applications routinely became corrupted and unusable. The list of problems seemed endless. At the end of the demo, Jobs fixed the dozen or so people in the room with a level stare and said, ‘We don’t have a product yet.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber320"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber320" class="calibre2">18</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The fact that Jobs seemed calm—instead of bringing his usual fire and brimstone—spooked everyone in the room. Vogelstein said one executive described the moment as “one of the few times at Apple when I got a chill.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Because the iPhone announcement was going to be the main event at Macworld in a few weeks, any sort of postponement would have been disastrous. “For those working on the iPhone, the next three months would be the most stressful of their careers,” Vogelstein wrote. “Screaming matches broke out routinely in the hallways. Engineers, frazzled from all-night coding sessions, quit, only to rejoin days later after catching up on their sleep. A product manager slammed the door to her office so hard that the handle bent and locked her in; it took colleagues more than an hour and some well-placed whacks with an aluminum bat to free her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The problem was that everything was new and nothing worked. The touch screen was new, so were the accelerometers. The proximity sensor, <a id="pageMap_230"></a>which turned off the screen when the user held the phone up to their face, developed a problem in a late prototype: It worked for most people, but it didn’t work if the user had long dark hair, which confused the sensor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We nearly shelved the phone because we thought there were fundamental problems that we can’t solve,” Jony told a business conference in London. “You have to detect all sorts of ear-shapes and chin shapes, skin color and hairdo . . . that was one of just many examples where we really thought, perhaps this isn’t going to work.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber321"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber321" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But just weeks before Macworld, Jony’s team had a prototype that worked well enough to show AT&amp;T. In December 2006, Jobs traveled to Las Vegas to show it to the wireless carrier’s CEO, Stan Sigman, who was “uncharacteristically effusive,” calling the iPhone “the best device I have ever seen.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber322"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber322" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The arrival of the iPhone at Macworld was the culmination of more than two and half years of intense hardship, learning and dedication to bring it to market. As one Apple executive summed it up, “Everything was a struggle. Every. Single. Thing was a struggle for the entire two-and-a-half years.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When launch day came in mid-summer 2007, Jony joined the whole design team at the flagship Apple retail store in San Francisco. “We were excited,” said Stringer. “We had something new. There was an incredible buzz. . . . And there was an enormous crowd outside. We wanted to feel that enthusiasm and see people, see their eyes when they get these new products, the first people to get them. When the doors opened, there was mayhem. It was like a carnival.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber323"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber323" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Stringer was overwhelmed with emotion. “We were obviously very, very proud. We’d worked really hard. It was—there was an enormous number of people that put in personal sacrifice and it was paying off in spades. It was a beautiful day.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL"><a id="pageMap_231"></a>The iPod had been regarded by a lot of pundits as Apple getting lucky, a fluke, a one-shot. When Apple entered the cutthroat cell phone market, it was predicted the iPhone would flop. Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer famously said it would never get any market share. But the iPhone was a hit from the start, and Apple used its old playbook of rapidly adding features and models.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple released the iPhone in mid-2007. By the end of the year, 3.7 million iPhones had been sold. By the first quarter of 2008, the sales volume of iPhones exceeded sales of Apple’s entire Mac line. And by the end of 2008, the company was selling three times as many iPhones per quarter as it was selling Macs. Revenue and profits were through the roof.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Jobs unveiled the iPhone at Macworld in January 2007, he invited his old friend Alan Kay to the launch. Jobs and Kay knew each other from Xerox PARC, and later Kay had been appointed an Apple fellow, a kind of elder statesman, and worked for a decade inside Apple’s Advanced Technology Group in the late nineties. Kay is famous for prophesizing the “Dynabook,” a tablet computer that would provide a window into all the world’s knowledge—back in 1968.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On iPhone launch day, Jobs turned to Kay and casually asked, “What do you think, Alan? Is it good enough to criticize?” The question was a reference to a comment made by Kay almost twenty-five years earlier, when he had deemed the original Macintosh “the first computer worth criticizing.” Kay considered Jobs’s question for a moment and then held up his moleskin notebook. “Make the screen at least five inches by eight inches and you will rule the world,’“ he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber324"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber324" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
