			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Two life-defining relationships were firmly established during Jony’s college days. The first, made official in August 1987, was his marriage as a second-year student to childhood sweetheart Heather Pegg. Also the child of a local schools inspector, she had been one year below Jony at Walton though the couple met at Wildwood Christian Fellowship. They married in Stafford and would later have twin boys: Charlie and Harry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Around the same time, Jony discovered another strong love: Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Throughout his school years, he demonstrated no affinity whatsoever for computers. Convinced he was technically inept, he felt frustrated because computers were clearly becoming useful tools in many aspects of life, a trend that seemed likely to gain momentum. Then, toward the end of his time at college, Jony met the Mac.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">From the first, Jony was astounded at how much easier to use the Mac was than anything else he had tried. The care the machine’s designers took to shape the whole user experience struck him; he felt an immediate connection to the machine and, more important, to the soul of the enterprise. It was the first time he felt the humanity of a product. “I<a id="x.904"></a>t was <a id="pageMap_29"></a>such a dramatic moment and I remember it so clearly,” he said. “There was a real sense of the people who made it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber54"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber54" class="calibre2">34</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I started to learn more about Apple, how it had been founded, its values and its structure,” Jony later said. “The more I learned about this cheeky, almost rebellious company, the more it appealed to me, as it unapologetically pointed to an alternative in a complacent and creatively bankrupt industry. Apple stood for something and had a reason for being that wasn’t just about making money.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber55"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber55" class="calibre2">35</a></sup></p>
