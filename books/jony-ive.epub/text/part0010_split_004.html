			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After the iMac, iBook and Power Mac, the last machine in Jobs’s 2×2 product plan was a notebook for professionals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony instructed De Iuliis and two other designers to rethink the professional laptop just as they had the consumer laptop. He wanted a new user experience, an honest use of materials and a machine that was easy to manufacture. He set them up in a special studio off site in a warehouse in San Francisco where they installed thousands of dollars of computers. Just six weeks later, they presented Jony with a notebook that fulfilled two out of three of his requests.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Titanium PowerBook G4 was the lightest and thinnest full-featured notebook yet to appear on the market. It had the first wide-screen laptop display, a big, beautiful expanse of screen that was ideally suited for working on high-end professional software, which often features numerous floating palette windows. But it would be a challenge to manufacture, and the new PowerBook would have an enclosure made from formed titanium shells separated by a plastic gasket. The whole machine was made rigid by a complex internal frame combined with several strengthening plates.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After coming up with the basic concept in just six weeks, Jony’s team <a id="pageMap_151"></a>spent months sweating every detail. The PowerBook featured a clever latch for the screen that descended from inside the lid as it was closed. To the delight of users, the latch seemed to pop out as if by magic, appearing at just the right time as the lid was nearly shut. New owners would open and close the lid obsessively just to see the latch appear and disappear.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The latch mechanism used a small magnet in the bottom half of the PowerBook’s body that pulled the latch out of a thin slot in the lid. It was a harbinger of things to come, as magnets would be used in a lot of clever ways in subsequent products, including the iPad 2, which would be awakened and put to sleep by a magnetic “Smart Cover.” One of the later flat-screen aluminum iMacs even had its screen attached by magnets, which allowed easy access to its guts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like the power button on the back of the original Macintosh, the PowerBook’s magnetic latch was the kind of detail that turned a good product into a great one. As Jerry Manock, the designer of the original Macintosh said, it’s the artisanal details that count. Jony would agree.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The decisive factor is fanatical care beyond the obvious stuff; the obsessive attention to details that are often overlooked,” said Jony.<a id="SuperscriptNumber230"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber230" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Years later, designer Chris Stringer described the ID studio’s obsessive attention to small things. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said. “If we design a button, there might be fifty models of the home button or a volume switch. We look at the edge detail and [ask] how far out does it protrude? Does it have a shaft? Is it round? Is it metal? Is it plastic? The size, length, width, height. Every single detail is very cleverly crafted.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber231"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber231" class="calibre2">18</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Detailing was a continual part of the design process, not something done at the end to make a product look pretty. It was as integral as anything else, and typical of Jony’s approach. “It doesn’t go from thought to sketch to model to production even though, in simplistic <a id="pageMap_152"></a>terms, that is the general sequence of events,” said Stringer. “We’ll go back and forth. We’ll go all the way to model, we’ll go to working with the PD and operations groups on the engineering side.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber232"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber232" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In design, details like buttons and latches that make a design pop have a name: They’re called “jewelry.” In the auto industry, door handles and radiator grilles have the same name and the same effect. The new Apple products took these elements to a new level. “We really focused on the jewel pieces,” said Satzger. “We strove for really high quality. We wanted beautiful finishing, really high-quality surfaces on them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The magnetic latch on the Titanium PowerBook was a good example of jewelry. To release the latch, there was a high-quality stainless steel button that when depressed would pop open the lid a bit, allowing users to get their fingers underneath it to open it. It was another artisanal touch that delighted owners, much the same as the popping lid Jony designed for the Lindy Newton.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s team instructed the supplier of the PowerBook’s power button to make several samples before getting the contract. Each sample contained twelve slightly different power buttons, all machined in stainless steel. “You can barely see the difference between them,” said Satzger, smiling apologetically at the group’s fastidiousness. “The subtleties are crazy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony predicted the PowerBook would be a hit when it was announced at the 2001 Macworld Expo in San Francisco. “People will have a visceral reaction to its weight and volume,” he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber233"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber233" class="calibre2">20</a></sup> Indeed they did. It sold out immediately and remained a hard find for months. The factories couldn’t keep up with demand.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although the PowerBook was an expensive machine, it attracted many new customers to the Apple platform, including geek cognoscenti. It showed up at a lot of high-tech conferences, and became the preferred <a id="pageMap_153"></a>machine of alpha geeks like Linux creator Linus Torvalds. It also did a lot for rehabilitating Apple’s reputation among movers and shakers in the tech industry. The iMac had been great, but it was a cute plastic toy for ordinary consumers. The Titanium PowerBook, on the other hand, was regarded as a serious machine for professionals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was also the design team’s first foray into metal and advanced metallurgical manufacturing techniques. Titanium is notoriously difficult to work with. Bare, untreated titanium has a beautiful luster, but it picks up fingerprints and scratches easily. Jony chose to paint the PowerBook, but over time, the paint wore off around the keyboard and palm rests, which attracted complaints.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite its popularity, there were other problems too. The case’s complex internal frame was made out of several different metals, and to make things like the magnetic latches work, parts of the case had to be made out of steel. The more parts, the more materials, the more problems. Over time, the different parts of the case tended to separate as the machine took knocks and bumps. Eventually these problems would lead the design team to pioneer a radical new manufacturing technique for its portables.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Along with the exotic metal PowerBook, Jony’s design team created a new plastic portable for the consumer and education markets. The new version of the iBook was designed in bright white plastic and had two USB ports, attributes memorialized in its name: Dual USB “Ice” iBook.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For the Ice iBook, Jony’s continued concern for durability prompted him to combine a polycarbonate shell with an internal magnesium frame. Critical components such as the hard drive were shock-mounted with rubber gaskets, like the engine in a car. Elements susceptible to damage, such as doors, external buttons and latches, were eliminated. Instead, the entire product was almost hermetically sealed by its external surfaces. Even the sleep-state light-emitting diode (LED) indicator did <a id="pageMap_154"></a>not penetrate the external skin and only became visible when the unit was asleep, as it gently cycled from dim to bright.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thanks to a clever L-shaped hinge, the display opened to rest unexpectedly far back from the keyboard, making the product feel expansive and accessible when in use but compact when closed. “When the iBook’s closed, it’s this smooth, rugged little pod,” said Jony in a promo video. “But as you open it, the geometry of the hinge moves the display away and down, which reveals this full-sized keyboard and large comfortable palm rest.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber234"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber234" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Ice iBook was made of transparent polycarbonate, with a white coating of paint applied to the inside surface. The transparent outer shell created a “halo” around the product, which gave the surface a surprising depth. It also made the product appear smaller than it actually was. It was scratch resistant, because the paint was on the inside. Painting the inside surface of the plastic may have been inspired by Jony’s experiment at RWG, where he painted slides with gouache to create his spectacular mock-up sketches. The halo would be a popular effect used on many other products, most notably the iPod, and it persists in the glass screen of the latest iPhone and iPad.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A clean, plain, small rectangular box, the Ice iBook cemented the shift in Jony’s design language from multicolored plastics toward plain black-and-white polycarbonate designs. (Although the first white computer was technically the “Snow” iMac in the summer of 2001, the shift to white plastic really gained notice with the Ice iBook, which also looked utterly unlike any other laptop at the time.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The new iBook is clearly from the same family as the PowerBook G4, but it certainly has its own distinct character,” said Jony. “It’s warmer. It’s happier. I really think it’s a much friendlier design.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber235"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber235" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony would transition most of Apple’s consumer products, including the iMac and iPod, to black-and-white polycarbonate casings. Most of <a id="pageMap_155"></a>the professional products, on the other hand, were redesigned using anodized aluminum.</p>
