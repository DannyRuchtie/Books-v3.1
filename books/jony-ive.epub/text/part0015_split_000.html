			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">I can’t think of a product that has defined an entire category and then has been completely redesigned in such a short period of time. It is really defined by the display. There are just no distractions.</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">While Jony’s group was secretly working on the iPad, Steve Jobs was telling the public and press that Apple had no intention of releasing a tablet. “Tablets appeal to rich guys with plenty of other PCs and devices already,” he said publicly. But Jobs was dissembling. “Steve never lost his desire to do a tablet,” said Phil Schiller.<a id="SuperscriptNumber325"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber325" class="calibre2">1</a></sup> In fact, while Jony’s design team was developing the iPhone, they were also actively working on tablets. Jobs was just waiting for the right time to bring a tablet to market.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One incentive to move forward was the appearance of netbooks, a category of small, inexpensive, low-powered laptops that launched in 2007. They quickly started to eat into laptop sales and, by 2009, netbooks accounted for 20 percent of the laptop market. But Apple never seriously considered making one. “Netbooks aren’t better than anything,” Steve Jobs said at the time. “They’re just cheap laptops.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber326"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber326" class="calibre2">2</a></sup> Nonetheless, the subject came up several times in executive meetings.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During one such high-level executive meeting in 2008, Jony proposed that the tablets in his lab could be Apple’s answer to the netbook. Jony suggested that a tablet was basically an inexpensive laptop without the <a id="pageMap_233"></a>keyboard. The idea appealed to Jobs, and Jony was given the go-ahead to transform the prototypes into a real product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Crucially, mobile technology had advanced significantly in just a few years since the iPhone had been launched. By then, the 035 tablet prototype from 2004 seemed big and unwieldy. But thanks to new screens and batteries, everyone understood that a tablet could be much lighter and slimmer. One of the major reasons the iPad hadn’t been green-lighted sooner was that the components like the screen and battery weren’t ready. “The technology was not there yet,” said a former Apple executive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony began by ordering twenty models made in varying sizes and screen-aspect ratios. They were laid out on one of the studio’s project tables for Jony and Jobs to play with. “That’s how we nailed what the screen size was,” Jony has said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber327"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber327" class="calibre2">3</a></sup> They had done the same thing earlier in finding the right size for the Mac mini and other products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Steve and Jony liked to do that with almost all products,” said a former engineer in the operations group. “They started off making a bunch of ‘appearance’ models and they’d make them in all sorts of sizes to find what they want.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But, as often happens, recollections seem to vary. According to an executive at Apple at the time, the screen size was also strongly influenced by a simpler piece of equipment: a standard piece of paper. “The size of the tablet was that of a sheet of paper,” he explained. “It was conceived as a legal note tablet, and we thought that was the right size. It was targeted at education and schools and e-reading.” Hardware was still another factor, as the guts of the iPad would be based not on the iBook but the iPod touch. Early on, the iPad was understood to be, in effect, a scaled up touch-screen iPod.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s ultimate goal was to make a device that needed no explanation and was fully intuitive. It was to be a “breathtakingly simple, beautiful <a id="pageMap_234"></a>device, something that you really want, and something that’s very easily understandable,” Stringer said. “You pick it up, you use it, something that . . . needs no explanation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That said, producing the “breathtakingly simple” can require an immense investment of time and creative energy.</p>
