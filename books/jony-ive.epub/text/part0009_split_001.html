<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">Inventing Steve Jobs, 1976 and After</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jobs’s plan for Apple was more than a matter of B-school economics: He planned to make industrial design the centerpiece of Apple’s comeback. Since his first incarnation at Apple (1976–1985), it had been apparent that design was a guiding force in the trajectory of Steve Jobs’s life.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Unlike Jony, Jobs had no formal design training, but he possessed an intuitive design sense that dated to his childhood. Jobs, early on, learned that good design wasn’t just on the exterior of an object. As Mike Ive had been for Jony, Jobs’s father was a formative influence on his son’s appreciation of design. “[My father] loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see,” Jobs recalled. His father refused to build a fence that wasn’t constructed as well on the <a id="pageMap_106"></a>back side as it was the front. “For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber154"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber154" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs grew up in a house inspired by the tract homes of Joseph Eichler, a postwar developer who brought a mid-century modern aesthetic to the architectural landscape of California. Although Jobs’s childhood home was probably a knockoff of an Eichler (what Eichler fans call a “Likeler”), it left an impression. Describing his childhood home, Jobs said, “I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much. It was the original vision for Apple.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber155"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber155" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Jobs, design amounted to more than appearances. “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like,” Jobs famously said. “People think it’s this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber156"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber156" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With the development of the Macintosh, Jobs got really serious about how-it-works industrial design, which he believed could be a key differentiator between Apple’s consumer-friendly, works-right-out-of-the-box philosophy and the bare bones, utilitarian packaging of early rivals like International Business Machines.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 1981, with the PC revolution not yet five years old, 3 percent of U.S. households had a personal computer (including toy systems like the Commodores and Ataris). Only about 6 percent of Americans had even encountered a PC at home or work. Jobs understood that the home market presented a huge opportunity. “IBM has it all wrong,” he would say. “They sell personal computers as data-processing machines, not as tools for individuals.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber157"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber157" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs and his chief designer, Jerry Manock, went to work on the Mac, with three design constraints. To keep it cheap and make it easy to manufacture, Jobs insisted on just one configuration, an echo of his <a id="pageMap_107"></a>hero Henry Ford’s Model T. Jobs’s new machine had to be a “crankless computer”: A new owner should just be able to plug the machine into the wall, press a button and it would work. The Macintosh would be the world’s first all-in-one PC, with the screen, disk drives and circuitry all housed in the same case, with a detachable keyboard and mouse that plugged in the back. In addition, it shouldn’t take up too much space on a desk, so Jobs and his design team decided it should have an unusual vertical orientation, with the disk drive below the monitor, instead of to the side like other machines at the time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The design process continued for several months, with a sequence of prototypes and endless discussions. Material evaluations led to the use of tough ABS plastic that was used to make LEGO bricks, which would give the new machine a fine, scratch-resistant texture. Troubled by the way earlier Apple IIs had turned orange in sunlight over time, Manock decided to make the Macintosh beige, initiating a trend that would last twenty years.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Jony would do in the next generation at Apple, Jobs paid close attention to every detail. Even the mouse was designed to reflect the shape of the computer, with the same proportions, and a single square button that corresponded to the shape and placement of the screen. The power switch was put around the back to stop it being switched off accidentally (especially by curious kids), and Manock thoughtfully put a smooth area around the switch to make it easier to find by touch. “That’s the kind of detail that turns an ordinary product into an artifact,” Manock said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber158"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber158" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Macintosh looked like a face, with a slot for the disk drive resembling a mouth and a chinlike keyboard recess at the bottom. Jobs loved it. This is what made the Macintosh look “friendly”—an anthropomorphic smiley face. “Even though Steve didn’t draw any of the lines, his ideas and inspiration made the design what it is,” designer <a id="pageMap_108"></a>Terry Oyama said later. “To be honest, we didn’t know what it meant for a computer to be ‘friendly’ until Steve told us.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber159"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber159" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It took five years—the Macintosh, conceived in 1979, was released in January 1984—but the product represented the first distillation of Jobs’s design philosophy. Unfortunately, the Macintosh was the last product that Steve Jobs would see to market during his first tenure at Apple. About eighteen months after launching the Mac, in September 1985, Steve Jobs lost a boardroom power struggle. John Sculley, the ex-PepsiCo marketing executive Jobs himself had recruited, took over. His design philosophy, though, would continue to be influential throughout his absence.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before his departure, Jobs talked about making Apple in the eighties what Italy’s Olivetti had been in the seventies, the undisputed world champion of industrial design. Design was hot in the eighties, especially in Europe, with groups like Italy’s Memphis Group<a id="SuperscriptNumber160"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber160" class="calibre2">10</a></sup> of architects and designers earning accolades for their bold, colorful designs (memorably described as “a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price”<a id="SuperscriptNumber161"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber161" class="calibre2">11</a></sup>). In March 1982, two years before the Macintosh was unveiled, Jobs decided Apple needed a world-class industrial designer to craft a uniform design language for all the company’s products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the time, Apple’s hardware was all over the place. The company’s different divisions—the Apple II division, the Mac division, Lisa peripherals—were all using different designers with different ideas. Apple’s products looked like they came from four different companies, not one. It drove Jobs crazy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs had Manock set up a design competition, in which potential candidates were asked to draft seven products, each named after a dwarf from Snow White. The name was inspired by the storybook Manock was reading to his young daughter; Jobs loved that it conjured up images of products that were distinctive, friendly and with personality.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_109"></a>Almost from the start, the front-runner was Hartmut Esslinger, a German industrial designer then in his mid-thirties. Like Jobs, Esslinger was a college dropout. He had gained notice designing TVs and other consumer electronics for Sony and Wega, a German company that Sony eventually bought. One of his TV designs for Wega was in bright green plastic, which the CEO of the company nicknamed “frog.” This no doubt influenced Esslinger to name his company Frog Design, which is also an acronym for Esslinger’s homeland: Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In May 1982, Esslinger flew to Cupertino to meet Jobs. They were alike—both natural entrepreneurs, brash and opinionated—and they bonded over a love of Braun and Mercedes. Jobs was particularly impressed that Esslinger had worked for Sony, a design-centric company that Jobs wanted Apple to emulate.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A master at pitching his ideas and philosophy, Esslinger also knew how to work hard. His group labored through four major design phases, and after months of work, put on an overwhelming show for Apple’s brass. While the other contenders in the competition made a handful of models, Esslinger’s group turned out forty beautifully finished models, two or three variations for each product. The other groups pitched designs in dark plastic with hard edges (like Sony’s stereo components from the eighties), but Esslinger’s designs were simple and sophisticated, made from lightly textured, cream-colored plastic. Like Jony, Esslinger wanted to differentiate Apple from the masculine design of eighties electronics and create a design language based on recurring elements that echoed the consistency of software that the Mac already provided.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs was delighted with the formal presentation of Esslinger’s work in March 1983: Esslinger was declared the winner of Show White and soon emigrated to California to set up his own studio, Frog Design, Inc., having agreed to provide exclusive services to Apple for an unprecedented $100,000 a month, plus billable time and expenses. Billings would <a id="pageMap_110"></a>quickly add up to $2 million a year, far more than competing design firms were earning from their clients.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs unceremoniously told Manock and the other in-house designers that they would be working for Esslinger, who was essentially an outside contractor, albeit one with special status. Manock was killing himself designing the first Mac, but Jobs told the hapless designers that they should consider themselves lucky to be in a position to learn from the talented Esslinger. Most worried about their tenuous jobs and, indeed, the move more or less ended Manock’s career at Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Esslinger’s emerging Snow White style made Apple’s best design efforts look clumsy and outdated. Snow White designs would eventually win all the major industry awards and be so widely copied that it became the de facto design language for the entire PC industry. It was too late to redesign the Mac, at that point, which had already been tooled at great expense, so Frog’s first major product for Apple using Snow White would be the Apple IIc, the fourth in the line of Apple IIs and the first attempt at a portable computer (the “c” stood for “compact”). More important, it was Apple’s first design-driven product (designed from the outside in, rather than the inside out); even with Jobs gone, he left behind a design evolution as his legacy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That shift in emphasis was compelling beyond the design department: Apple’s engineers bent over backward to accommodate Esslinger’s designers, rather than fighting their ideas. It was a small but subtle shift; an early attempt to make Apple design driven rather engineering driven. By the time he returned, however, the old paradigm, with the engineers wielding the power, had returned, as Jony Ive had discovered.</p>
