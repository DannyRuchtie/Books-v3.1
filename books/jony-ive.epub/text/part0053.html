			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">There’s a T-shirt you can buy at the Company Store on Apple’s campus. It says, “I visited the Apple campus. But that’s all I’m allowed to say.” That just about sums it up when reporting on Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Trying to persuade people to talk about the company isn’t easy. Apple people don’t talk, even about things that happened thirty years ago. The company is so secretive, that divulging anything—anything at all—is a firing offense. Everyone associated with the company—employees, contractors, partners—has signed a stack of nondisclosure agreements, which threaten not just termination but prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. Employees are mum about current product plans, which is understandable, but they won’t talk about old projects either. The secrecy extends to every single thing Apple does, but especially applies to its internal processes, which it considers industrial trade secrets. Apparently, knowing how Apple conducts meetings, for example, could give competitors a leg up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple is the ultimate need-to-know culture. It operates like a spy organization. Staffers are told the absolute bare minimum to do their (highly specialized) jobs. Only a handful of executives and senior VPs have the whole picture, and often they don’t know what happened in other departments outside their own, or what happened in the rank and file.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Secrecy is so steeply embedded in Apple’s culture, keeping mum is as natural as breathing. Apple employees live in an Apple bubble. They do not attend conferences or give talks, and they barely circulate in Silicon Valley’s professional or social circles. Friends of employees know not to ask their Apple friends about work. If the subject comes up, it’s <a id="pageMap_274"></a>met with an apologetic smile. They won’t even share with their spouses. One female designer interviewed for this book said she and her husband are especially careful not to talk about work because everyone expects them to; they work extra hard not to.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We contacted more than two hundred people for this book, mostly current Apple staffers or those who had recently left the company. Some were willing to talk on the record, but many wanted to keep their names out of print. Apple did not respond to several requests for comment.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nonetheless, my research partners and I did get a number of people to talk, on and off the record, about Apple, Jony Ive and their unique work culture. Notably, we got some major players, including some who have worked closely with Jony for decades. They took us inside the studio and inside the minds behind Apple, in an unprecedented manner. The information they provided, and the details they were able to reveal about the company over many years, were immeasurably useful.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thanks to their interviews, coupled with extensive research, and the available videos, transcripts, launch archives, books, articles and the Apple product output itself, we offer the fullest picture available of the true events behind Jony Ive’s career and influence at Apple.</p>
