			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Before presenting ideas to Jobs or another executive, the making of realistic mock-ups are outsourced to a model shop. The goal is to create models that look as much as possible like a final, finished product, which requires specialist equipment and skills. Jony’s group frequently uses Fancy Models Corporation, a model-making company based in Fremont and run by Ching Yu, a model maker from Hong Kong. Most of the iPhone and iPad prototypes were made by Fancy Models. Each model costs in the range of $10,000 to $20,000. “Apple spent millions on models made by that company,” said a former designer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By contrast, the CNC machines at Apple, though capable of making pretty refined models, are used mainly for fairly crude early models, or parts that are needed quickly, such as plastic shapes and smaller aluminum bits. The Apple CNC machines are rarely used to produce final models.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The models play a crucial role in deciding on the final design. When designing the Mac mini, Apple’s relatively inexpensive “headless” Mac, <a id="pageMap_169"></a>Jony had about a dozen models made up of different sizes. The models ranged from very large to very small. He lined them up on one of the presentation tables in the studio. “We were there with some of the VPs and Jony,” said Gautam Baksi, a former Apple product design engineer. “They pointed at the smallest one and they said, ‘Well, obviously that is too small; that kinda looks ridiculous.’ Then they pointed at the other side and said, ‘Well, that’s too large; no one wants a computer that big. How do you find what’s right in the middle?’ And they talked through that process.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The decision about the size of the case might seem trivial, but it would influence what kind of hard drive the Mini could contain. If the case were large enough, the computer could be given a 3.5-inch drive, commonly used in desktop machines and relatively inexpensive. If Jony chose a small case, it would have to use a much more expensive 2.5-inch laptop drive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and the VPs selected an enclosure that was just 2 mm too small to use a less expensive 3.5-inch drive. “They picked it based on what it looks like, not on the hard drive, which will save money,” Baksi said. He said Jony didn’t even bring up the issue of the hard drive; it wouldn’t have made a difference. “Even if we provided that feedback, it’s rare they would change the original intent,” he said. “They went with a purely aesthetic form of what it should look like and how big it should be.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber250"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber250" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
