			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After his placement at RWG, Jony returned north. He resumed studying for his degree but, later that year, he won a prestigious travel bursary (grant) from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, better known as the Royal Society of Arts or RSA.<a id="SuperscriptNumber44"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber44" class="calibre2">24</a></sup> <a id="pageMap_24"></a>Established in 1754 in a Covent Garden coffee shop, the RSA is an ancient British charity, one of Britain’s oldest and finest institutions for the promotion of social change.<a id="SuperscriptNumber45"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber45" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The highly competitive bursaries attract entries from hundreds of students all over the country and each bears the sponsorship of a particular company. The RSA grants are, in effect, a recruiting tool, a means for corporations to find hot student designers. The first year Jony entered the Office and Domestic Equipment bursary challenge, the sponsor was Sony.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His winning entry was one of his major college projects, a futuristic concept for a telephone. The phone was a blue-sky project, an exercise in futuristic design, assigned to get the students engaged in What if? thinking. Newcastle put a heavy emphasis on emerging technology at the time, with technologies like the Sony Walkman altering existing modes of listening to music. Though those early devices look primitive today, such portable technology was beginning to become part of everyone’s lives. Every student had to have a Walkman.<a id="SuperscriptNumber46"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber46" class="calibre2">26</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Students at Newcastle Polytechnic understood their careers would be defined by technology. “We were the guys who were told we had the job of bringing it into the mainstream,” said Jony’s fellow student Craig Mounsey. “This really was a core part of the course culture . . . [This is] why the course was so successful. We were encouraged to adopt and explore any emerging technology and integrate it into our designs. Further we were encouraged to speculate about future technology directions and their implications.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In responding to the challenge, Jony designed a phone that was an innovative take on landline devices. This was years before the mobile phone became ubiquitous, and his winning design was for an innovative landline phone. Characteristically, it managed to rethink the standard image of what a phone was expected to look like. At the time, phones <a id="pageMap_25"></a>had a receiver with a headset attached by a coiled wire, but Jony’s resembled a stylized white question mark.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He called it, somewhat pretentiously, The Orator. The all-in-white phone was made from a one-inch-diameter plastic tube. The base contained the mouthpiece; the user was to hold the phone by the stalk or leg of the question mark; the curve of the question rose to the earpiece speaker.<a id="SuperscriptNumber47"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber47" class="calibre2">27</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The design may not have been very practical, but it was great design. It won Jony a travel award worth £500, which, for the moment, he put aside. As for the phone, set designers for a Jackie Chan sci-fi movie got wind of it and asked to use it as a prop. Jony declined because he thought his prototype was too delicate for use on a movie set.<a id="SuperscriptNumber48"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber48" class="calibre2">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The RSA hadn’t seen the last of Jony. A year later, he teamed up with his friend David Tonge to enter another student bursary challenge. This time, the business services manufacturer Pitney Bowes was the main sponsor of the competition, and the winner would visit the company’s headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In their last year at college, Jony and Tonge each had to complete a major project, largely self-driven, and a dissertation as a requirement for the Design for Industry course. Tonge was designing aluminum office chairs, while Jony was working on a hearing aid–microphone combination for use by hard-of-hearing students in a classroom.<a id="SuperscriptNumber49"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber49" class="calibre2">29</a></sup> The hearing aid would eventually be exhibited at the Young Designers Centre Exhibition 1989 at the Design Centre in Haymarket, London, but for the competition, the two soon-to-be graduates were determined to win and so devised another product altogether.<a id="SuperscriptNumber50"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber50" class="calibre2">30</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We felt we could use both our skills to frankly speaking—win,” said Tonge. “At that time I was building two fully working aluminum prototype office chairs for my final project and Jonathan was doing his hearing aids. I guess we felt a large object was somewhere in between these two and our joint skills. And we were ambitious.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_26"></a>Jony and Tonge were strategic about entering the RSA travel competition. They reviewed the different project briefs, effectively request-for-proposal descriptions that specified possible entries, before choosing to design an “intelligent ATM.” The futuristic ATM promised to be both an interesting challenge and a good fit for their combined skills.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They figured out how to work together to come up with something winning, aesthetically pleasing and useful. Tonge was delighted with the potential collaboration. “It was a scale of product Jonathan enjoyed, could control and excelled at,” said Tonge. “The level of finish was what was always amazing about his work relative to others. Others were and are capable of the conceptual thought and creativity but very few capable of that level of finish. . . . [I]t’s still the standout component of his work.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and Tonge combined labors to create a flatscreen ATM machine: clean, unadorned and, in the Jony Ive way, made of white plastic. It won the Pitney Bowes’ Walter Wheeler Attachment Award, which included a much larger prize than the previous bursary: £1,500.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Years later, Tonge, who went on to have a successful design career at IDEO and now runs his London design studio, The Division, is still proud of their project and the effort they invested. “We did consider the relationship of the piece [the ATM] to users, disability and the space it was living in. It was a very polished piece of work that—without being arrogant—was visually and in detail way ahead of what most students and many professional designers were doing at the time. Hence, I think the judges were just bowled over.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony, too, took great pride in his undergraduate work. For his final-year presentation at university, he refined the telephone he’d submitted for the bursary and, when he was ready for his final-year presentation, he invited his friend from RWG, Clive Grinyer, to come up and see it. Grinyer made the five-hour drive from London to Jony’s tiny apartment <a id="pageMap_27"></a>in the tough Gateshead section of Newcastle. When he arrived, Grinyer was amazed to find the apartment filled with more than a hundred foam model prototypes of Jony’s project, his design discipline on display. When most students might build half a dozen models, Jony had built a hundred.<a id="SuperscriptNumber51"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber51" class="calibre2">31</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’d never seen anything like it: the sheer focus to get it perfect,” recalled Grinyer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer said the differences from one model to the next were subtle, but the step-by-step evolution betrayed Jony’s drive to thoroughly explore his ideas and get it right. Building scores of models and prototypes would become another trademark in his career at Apple. “It was incredible that he had made so many and that each one was subtly different,” Grinyer said. “I imagine Charles Darwin would have connected with them. It was like watching a piece of evolution really. Jonathan’s desire for perfection meant that every single model had a tiny change and the only way he could understand if it was the right change or not was to make a physical model of it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber52"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber52" class="calibre2">32</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony also invited his sponsor from RWG, Phil Gray, who also vividly remembered the polished final model of the phone. “It was an exquisite piece of design—very cleverly conceived,” said Gray. “It was very logical, beautifully thought out. The model was fantastic. Remember, at that time there were no mobile phones. There was no iconic telephone. Telephones were basically a box on the table with a dial or a keypad and a handset over it. So Jony’s design was very radical. And very well presented, in terms of its logic and ergonomics—as well as being eminently simplistic.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The professors at Newcastle Polytechnic shared the admiration for the work: Jony’s degree exhibition earned him a first, the UK’s highest degree distinction.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He gained the respect of admiration of professionals in the field, <a id="pageMap_28"></a>earning the status of a respected peer at barely twenty years of age. “His exhibition was extraordinary,” said Gray.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony had also been the first undergraduate student to win two travel bursaries from the RSA. In retrospect, RSA archivist Melanie Andrews, who has helped administer the RSA awards for decades, made a telling point about an early sign of the prodigal Jony’s abilities. “In both these projects,” Andrews observed, “he displayed an interest in both the hardware and software design of each, which has been the winning formula for Apple products.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber53"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber53" class="calibre2">33</a></sup></p>
