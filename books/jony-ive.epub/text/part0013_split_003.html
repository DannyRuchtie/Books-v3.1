			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Another reason Apple shifted manufacturing to China was that the design team started designing products in aluminum, and that’s where the supply chain was located. The Titanium PowerBook G4 had been a big hit, but titanium is an expensive and difficult metal to work with. Plus, it had to be coated in a metallic paint to protect against scratches and fingerprints, but the paint had a tendency to flake off. When Jony’s first prototypes for the iPod mini didn’t work in acrylic and steel, he shifted to anodized aluminum.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">According to his design team’s research, aluminum looked like a good material for laptop cases and iPods. It is strong and light, and it can be finished in a range of colors when an anodized coating is bonded chemically to the metal. At that stage, Jony and his crew knew little about aluminum manufacturing, so they started researching camera manufacturers like Sony, which produced a lot of cameras in aluminum.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These Japanese-based manufacturers turned out elegant, long-lasting and well-made products. But the aluminum’s point of origin was in China. “We got introduced into that supply chain,” said Satzger. “I remember many trips to go over to understand how you do things with aluminum.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple has taken much flak for outsourcing to China, but when Jony and the team first started using aluminum, they tried to work with manufacturers stateside. Satzger, who was in charge of materials and <a id="pageMap_205"></a>finishes for Jony’s group, made the initial contacts. He researched the suppliers to find companies that could make components in the quality and quantity that Apple required.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the design team was creating the first Mac mini, Satzger started working with a U.S.-based aluminum supplier. The directive from Tim Cook’s operations group was clear: They wanted the Mac mini to be manufactured in the United States. The U.S. supplier looked like a good bet because it was able to supply high-quality aluminum that was relatively free of impurities and would anodize well.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Mac mini looked relatively simple, but its case was surprisingly complex. The mini’s square case was made from sheet aluminum extruded into a square shape, which was then machined to achieve the right tolerances and finish, especially on the top. Then the case had to be anodized. Again, the design group had exacting requirements, as the anodized layer had to be just the right texture, color, gloss and thickness.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger spent months working with the U.S. supplier but as the deadline approached, the company failed to produce sample cases. A stressed-out Satzger went to the operations group. “We reached a point in the program where I said to the representative of the operations team that was pushing the move toward manufacturing in the USA, ‘We have a really tight schedule, and the [US manufacturer has] not yet delivered a part in spec from the extrusion machine; they haven’t delivered a finished part. When are they going to do this? If they don’t deliver, we don’t have a product. Where is our backup plan?’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was none. An increasingly frustrated Satzger observed that the American supplier had no concept of the quality that was required by Apple. “At Apple, good enough is not good enough,” said Satzger. “American companies could not understand the quality that is required for a customer-facing part on an Apple product—the little things that customers notice.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber300"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber300" class="calibre2">33</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_206"></a>By contrast, when Jony’s team went overseas for other projects, the Asian suppliers bent over backward to get the contract. “We first went to Japan, and started using titanium, and moved from there onto aluminum for the first iPods and PowerBooks,” remembered Satzger. “Then we were able to take that knowledge and experience and move, along with a couple Japanese companies, into China and we could say to people such as Foxconn, which had been molding parts for us, ‘Can you make basic sheet metal for us?’ and we started working with them from there. In China, their attitude was very much, ‘We’re going to work on a product to make sure it meets all its specs.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber301"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber301" class="calibre2">34</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Mac mini would be produced in Asia, along with iPod minis and other products, at Foxconn.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another product, the Power Mac G5 tower, would mark a big shift in the relationship between Apple and Foxconn. The design group wanted to make the tower in aluminum instead of plastic, as it had done with its predecessor, the Power Mac G4. Even by Apple’s standards, the project was immensely challenging. “Multiple people got shifted [to different jobs] because they just couldn’t do it,” said Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The project took more than a year. One cause of the delays was the 2003 outbreak of SARS, which quarantined some of the design team at Foxconn, including Jony. “I stayed for three months in a dormitory to work on the process,” he said. “Ruby and others said it would be impossible, but I wanted to do it because Steve and I felt that the anodized aluminum had a real integrity to it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber302"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber302" class="calibre2">35</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs wanted the case to be an extruded part, and he thought the big swooping handles on the previous towers were really important to the image of the product. Jony’s team started looking for a huge extruded aluminum tube that could be flattened like a lozenge, and then have two holes scooped out to create the handles. But they found that the only extruded aluminum tubes at the time were eighteen-inch tubes <a id="pageMap_207"></a>made for plumbing, which would be too small to suit their needs. Jony’s team investigated whether they could take two extrusions and join them together.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As they struggled, Satzger suggested that instead of using extrusions, the case could be done by the process of roll forming, the way steel gutters are made. A flat sheet of aluminum could be bent at various points as it is passed through a series of rollers to make the lozenge shape. When Satzger suggested this in one of the group’s biweekly brainstorming meetings, one of the other designers said it wasn’t a good idea because Jobs had set his mind on an extruded case.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t get it,” the other designer told Satzger. “Steve wants it extruded.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, you don’t get it,” Satzger replied, “it’s not possible.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, Satzger went to Jobs and persuaded him to go with the roll process, despite the opposition of the whole team. The sheets were roll formed into a C shape, with a large door installed on the open side. At first, Jony’s team was concerned about the two small joints on the open side (they wanted it seamless), but eventually decided they could live with it because the joints couldn’t be seen from the front.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Because customers would be opening the machine up, Jony decided they had to design the internal components too. “That was the first time we went internal,” said Satzger. “We controlled board color [the color of the motherboard]; we controlled every connector, every cable. We designed every part inside it: the fan housing, the plenum for the air flow.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s team spent months trying to find a good way to lock the door in place. Their first efforts were elaborate locking mechanisms on the door itself, but those ruined the case’s austere surface. Next they decided the G4 tower would have a locking ring, like the recessed deck latch on a sailboat. In one of the brainstorms, Satzger suggested putting the latch <a id="pageMap_208"></a>on the back of the machine. “I finally said, ‘Why does it have to be on the door? Look at the hood latch on your car. Don’t interrupt a surface with other details. Leave it for the Apple logo.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The team designed a latch that resembles an automobile hood latch connected to a pair of slender deadbolts. The latch is indeed on the back of the machine and, when activated, it slides deadbolts on the insides of the door at the top and bottom that hold it in place. It’s complex but elegant, with no sign of the mechanism from the outside.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the first cases came off the line, Jony saw that the new machine would become a showpiece. Machines in this category were usually put under a desk, but this one looked so good, Jony figured, it would be put on top of desks instead. That meant all the surfaces had to be treated like the front.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With most products, the front is what’s called an “A” surface. As the best surface, it has to be finished to the highest standards. The sides are “B” surfaces, the backs “C,” the insides “D” surfaces. But, said Satzger, “This product was so beautiful, everything was an ‘A’ surface.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the design team conveyed this directive to the manufacturer, Foxconn was flabbergasted. “They were like, ‘What do you mean? This is crazy,’” recalled Satzger. “It got to the point where Foxconn’s team said we’ve never done anything like this, we just can’t.” In the end, they would meet Apple’s standards.</p>
