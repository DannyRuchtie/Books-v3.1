			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title">Jobs Returns to Apple</h1>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">The thing is, it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—JONY IVE</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">On the morning of July 9, 1997, several dozen members of Apple’s top staff were summoned to an early-morning meeting. In an auditorium at company HQ, Gilbert Amelio, who’d been Apple’s CEO for approximately eighteen months, shuffled onto the stage. “Well, I’m sad to report that it’s time for me to move on,” he said, then quietly left the auditorium. Apple’s board had just fired him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fred Anderson, the interim CEO, said a few words before Steve Jobs took the stage. Jobs had been brought in as an adviser when Apple bought NeXT, his struggling software company, and, after firing Amelio, the board asked him to take over.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs looked like a bum, wearing shorts and sneakers and several days’ stubble. It was almost exactly twelve years since he had been ousted from the company over a previous July 4th weekend.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me what’s wrong with this place,” he said to the group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before anyone could reply, he burst out: “It’s the products. The products suck! There’s no sex in them anymore.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was in the room, sitting toward the back. He wanted to quit. But as he sat there thinking about returning to England with his wife, Jobs said something that gave him pause. Jobs told the group that Apple would be returning to its roots. “I remember very clearly Steve announcing that our goal is not just to make money but to make great <a id="pageMap_102"></a>products,” Jony later recalled. “The decisions you make based on that philosophy are fundamentally different from the ones we had been making at Apple.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber151"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber151" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Much was about to change in how Apple was run, beginning with the product lineup. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company had forty products on the market. To appreciate the baffling nature of Apple’s kitchen-sink strategy at the time, consider the company’s computer lineup.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were four main lines: the Quadra, the Power Mac, the Performa and the PowerBook. Each was split into a dozen different models, which were delineated from one another with confusing product names straight out of a Sony catalog (for example, the Performa 5200CD, Performa 5210CD, Performa 5215CD and Performa 5220CD). And that was just computers. Apple had branched out into a wide-ranging product portfolio, selling everything from printers, scanners and monitors to Newton handhelds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To Jobs, this made no sense.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What I found when I got here was a zillion and one products,” Jobs later said. “It was amazing. And I started to ask people, now why would I recommend a 3400 over a 4400? When should somebody jump up to a 6500, but not a 7300? And after three weeks, I couldn’t figure this out. If I couldn’t figure this out . . . how could our customers figure this out?”<a id="SuperscriptNumber152"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber152" class="calibre2">2</a></sup> The product line was so complicated that Apple had to print elaborate flowcharts to explain to customers (and as a cheat sheet for employees) what the differences between Apple’s products were.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As chaotic as Apple’s portfolio was, it had nothing on the anarchy of Apple’s organization chart. Apple had grown into a bloated Fortune 500 company with thousands of engineers and even more managers, many of whom had overlapping jobs and responsibilities. Lots of them were exceptionally talented, but there was no central command and control. <a id="pageMap_103"></a>“Apple, pre-Jobs, was brilliant, energetic, chaotic and nonfunctional,” recalled Don Norman.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In fact, Apple’s restructuring was under way before Jobs returned. Jobs joined the fray. He looked at everything: product design, marketing, the supply chain. Jobs started a thorough product review; he set up in a large conference room and called in the product teams, one at a time. The teams, often numbering twenty or thirty people, would present their products and take questions from Jobs and other executives. At first they wanted to give PowerPoint presentations, but Jobs quickly banned them. He saw PowerPoints as rambling and nonsensical; he preferred getting people to talk and asking them questions. In these meetings, it soon became clear to Jobs that Apple was a rudderless ship.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After several weeks, during a big strategy meeting, Jobs had had enough.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop!” he screamed, “This is crazy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He jumped up and went to the whiteboard. He drew a simple chart of Apple’s annual revenues. The chart showed the sharp decline, from $12 billion a year to $10 billion, and then $7 billion. Jobs explained that Apple couldn’t be a profitable $12 billion company, or a profitable $10 billion company, but it could be a profitable $6 billion company.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That meant radically simplifying Apple’s product pipeline. How? Jobs erased the whiteboard and drew a very simple two-by-two grid in its place. Across the top he wrote “Consumer” and “Professional,” and down the side, “Portable” and “Desktop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Welcome to Apple’s new product strategy, he said. Apple would sell only four machines. Two would be notebooks, the other two desktops. Two machines aimed at pros, two machines aimed at consumers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was a radical move, cutting the company to the bone. Under Amelio, the plan had been to offer more and more products. Jobs <a id="pageMap_104"></a>proposed the opposite. In a single stroke, Jobs doomed dozens of software projects, and eliminated almost every product from Apple’s hardware lineup. Over the next eighteen months, more than 4,200 full-time staff were laid off. By 1998, Apple had shrunk to only 6,658 employees, half the 13,191 the company had in 1995.<a id="SuperscriptNumber153"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber153" class="calibre2">3</a></sup> But the balance sheet was brought back into control.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The most controversial decision of Jobs’s first months was the late 1997 killing of the Newton, Apple’s PDA, which, after Jony’s Lindy, was in its seventh generation. A money loser from the start, Amelio’s administration had tried to spin off the Newton into its own division but the then-CEO had changed his mind at the last minute. As an adviser, Jobs had tried to persuade Amelio to shut down the Newton. It had never really worked right, and it had a stylus, which Jobs hated. Despite a small and dedicated following, it hadn’t taken off with a mass audience. Plus, Jobs saw it as John Sculley’s baby. Though it was the only really innovative thing Sculley achieved under his tenure, Jobs had many reasons to end the Newton’s brief life.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most executives would have thought twice about killing a well-loved product, and Newton lovers flooded Infinite Loop’s parking lots with placards and loudspeakers. (“I give a fig for the Newton,” one sign read.) PDAs were on the rise, thanks to the success of handhelds like the Palm Pilot, but to Jobs, the Newton was a distraction. He wanted Apple to concentrate on computers, its core product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs aimed at making innovative products again, but he didn’t want to compete in the broader market for personal computers, which was dominated by companies making generic machines for Microsoft’s Windows operating system. These companies competed on price, not features or ease of use. Jobs figured theirs was a race to the bottom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Instead, he argued, there was no reason that well-designed, well-made computers couldn’t command the same market share and margins <a id="pageMap_105"></a>as a luxury automobile. A BMW might get you to where you are going in the same way as a Chevy that costs half the price, but there will always be those who will pay for the better ride in the sexier car. Rather than competing with commodity PC makers like Dell, Compaq and Gateway, why not make only first-class products with high margins so that Apple could continue to develop even better first-class products? The company could make much bigger profits from selling a $3,000 machine rather than a $500 machine, even if they sold fewer of them. Why not, then, just concentrate on making the best $3,000 machines around?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The potential merits of Jobs’s strategy for the company finances were clear. Fewer products meant less inventory, which could have an immediate effect on the bottom line. In fact, Jobs was able to save Apple $300 million in inventory in just one year, and avoid having warehouses full of unsold machines that might have needed to be written off if they failed to sell.</p>
