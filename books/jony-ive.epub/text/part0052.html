			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">First and foremost, I’d like to thank my literary agent, Ted Weinstein, for pushing me to do this book. The team at Portfolio, including the boss, Adrian Zackheim, have been great. Natalie Horbachevsky and Brooke Carey did an excellent job editing, and Hugh Howard performed a postproduction miracle editing the manuscript and shaping the narrative.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jose Garcia Fermoso and my brother, Alex Kahney, provided invaluable help finding, contacting and interviewing sources.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">I’d like to thank John Brownlee for helping me with the writing and running of the Cult of Mac blog in my many long absences. Thanks also to my colleagues on the blog: Charlie, Buster, Killian, Alex, Rob and Erfon, for minding the shop and doing a great job.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The book has benefitted greatly from the reporting of others, in particular Paul Kunkel’s <em class="calibre3">AppleDesign</em>, Luke Dormehl’s <em class="calibre3">The Apple Revolution</em> and Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs.</p>
