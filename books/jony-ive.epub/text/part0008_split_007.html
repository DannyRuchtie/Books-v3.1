<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_7">Chaos Reigns</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Brunner quit just in time—at least, for him. Just days after Jony took over, Apple warned that the crucial holiday buying season for 1995 would fall far short of expectations, thanks to an overabundance of cheaper, low-end systems, and a shortage of more profitable PowerBooks and high-end desktops.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Our warehouse was full of Yugos at a time when everyone was buying Mercedes,” said Satjiv Chalil, the VP of marketing at the time.<a id="SuperscriptNumber143"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber143" class="calibre2">33</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Until then Apple had appeared to be flying high. But that troubled holiday quarter would be followed by two years of plunging revenues, a free-falling stock price and a rotating door of lackluster CEOs. Apple’s <a id="pageMap_96"></a>tumble was quick and dramatic. In 1994, Apple commanded nearly 10 percent of the worldwide multibillion-dollar market for personal computers, making it the second biggest computer manufacturer in the world after the giant IBM.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But in 1995, Microsoft released its new operating system, Windows 95, which took off like a rocket. Windows 95 was Microsoft’s most shameful rip-off of the Mac operating system yet, but the software made their PCs good-enough facsimiles of the Mac. Cheap, utilitarian Windows 95 machines flew off the shelves, while Apple’s overpriced, incompatible machines did not.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Microsoft licensed its operating system to dozens of hardware makers, who competed stiffly and drove down prices. To stay afloat, Apple tried a desperate tactic. It licensed the Macintosh operating system to several computer makers, including Power Computing, Motorola, Umax and others, but the Mac market remained flat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the first quarter of 1996, Apple reported a loss of $69 million and laid off 1,300 staff. In February, the board fired CEO Michael Spindler, who had taken over for John Sculley, appointing in his place Gil Amelio, a veteran of the chip industry with a reputation as a turnaround artist. But in the eighteen months that Amelio was on the job, he proved ineffectual and unpopular. Apple lost $1.6 billion, its market share plummeted from 10 to 3 percent, and the stock collapsed. Amelio laid off thousands of workers, but he was raking in about $7 million in salary and benefits while sitting on $26 million in stock, according to the <em class="calibre3">New York Times</em>. He lavishly refurbished Apple’s executive offices and, it was soon revealed, negotiated a golden parachute worth about $7 million. The <em class="calibre3">Times</em> reported employees’ view that Apple’s governance during this period was a “kleptocracy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Internally, the company was extremely fractured, split into dozens of different groups, each with its own agenda, which often conflicted. To make matters worse, Apple had become an experiment in extreme <a id="pageMap_97"></a>democracy. In reaction partly to the tyrannical ways of Steve Jobs, the company had transformed itself into a bottom-up, rather than a top-down organization.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There had to be consensus on every decision, involving all the interested parties. Steering committees would be set up to guide new products to market. As product designer Terry Christensen put it: “A lot of people considered Jobs’ approach tyrannical and misguided. Funneling an entire project through one person, be it Jobs or another visionary leader, inevitably resulted in lopsided products that exhibited all the strengths and weaknesses of its creator, like the first Mac. Instead, the steering committee approach brought every discipline involved in a project together—engineering, software, marketing, product design, industrial design, manufacturing—and required discussion and consensus at every stage of development.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber144"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber144" class="calibre2">34</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Product development by consensus proved extremely bureaucratic. Whenever a new product was proposed, three documents had to be drawn up: a marketing requirement document, an engineering requirement document and a user-experience document. Mark Rolston, SVP of creative at Frog, summed it up this way: “Marketing is what people want; engineering is what we can do; user experience is ‘Here’s how people like to do things.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber145"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber145" class="calibre2">35</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The three documents would be sent upstairs to be reviewed by a committee of executives. If they were approved, a team leader (the “champion”) would be assigned to the project and the design group would get a budget. Then it would go back to the marketing, engineering and user-experience groups for more work. Don Norman: “The team would work on expanding the three requirement documents, inserting plans on how they hoped to meet the marketing, engineering and user-experience needs—figures for the release date, ad cycle, pricing details and the like.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber146"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber146" class="calibre2">36</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Norman said in some ways, it was “a well-structured process” but he <a id="pageMap_98"></a>acknowledged its shortcomings. Not only was it slow, cumbersome and bureaucratic, it inevitably led to compromises. When one team wanted to do it like this, and another team like that, feature creep took over, resulting in a lack of cohesion in the product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The businessman wants to create something for everyone, which leads to products that are middle of the road,” said Brunner. “It becomes about consensus, and that’s why you rarely see the spark of genius.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber147"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber147" class="calibre2">37</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even if a great idea came along, it was impossible to get anything done. Norman described just such an occasion.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I remember vividly Jony Ive coming to me one day,” said Norman. “Then, high-end Apple customers would buy a machine and the first thing they wanted to do was take it apart and add a lot more memory, or add a video card or a second processor. And it was a pain to open the machine and you couldn’t access the memory and you had to take out some parts. And Jony had figured out a way to get around this, with a desktop computer that had two fasteners which you simply unhooked . . . making it trivial to add and change the machine’s memory. And I thought this was marvelous.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The problem was, the hardware people refused to build it. So Jony and I went around the company going from vice president to vice president trying to convince them. If they said the idea would be too expensive, Jony presented them a price analysis showing that it wasn’t; if they said it would take too long to produce and ship the new idea, Jony would show them that he had already spoken to the factory, and they could do it in the amount of time available. It went on and on, for several weeks. Finally the CEO adopted Jony’s idea and it was accepted. But that was the old Apple—it wouldn’t happen like that today.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s idea for easy access to the insides eventually made its way to market with a Power Mac 9600 in August 1997, and became a mainstay for all the Macintosh tower designs that followed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_99"></a>Sometimes the fiefdoms, the bureaucracy, doomed solid new ideas. The most interesting product to come out of Jony’s design group in the late 1990s was the eMate, a small, inexpensive plastic computer for schoolkids. It was a curvaceous clamshell made of translucent green plastic, whose see-through look would be copied for the first iMac. Everyone wanted one. It had a huge lust factor, but it bombed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This product was driven by industrial design and it died because it didn’t have the right champion at Apple,” Norman said. “It died because there was a fight over it among the different divisions. Should it run Newton software? Should it run Apple OS software? Which existing computer was it going to compete with? No one came forward and said, ‘This could be a great computer for schools. What kind of software should it run, and how are kids going to use it?’ No one looked into its use backwards, starting from what kids would want to do with it and so what should go into it. And so due to the lack of cohesion at Apple, the eMate died.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The eMate’s uniqueness was a rarity in the interim that followed Brunner’s departure. Most of the products were boring me-too designs, which reflected the engineering-driven culture at the core of the company. Much of their work was skin jobs. The chaos of trying to create in what seemed like an increasingly adversarial environment wore on Jony. Only a few months after being put in charge of the design group, he also was thinking of quitting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was a company that certainly wasn’t innovating,” Jony said at the time. “We lost our identity and looked to competition for leadership.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber148"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber148" class="calibre2">38</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Amelio had little appreciation for design. “There wasn’t that feeling of putting care into a product, because we were trying to maximize the money we made,” Jony said. “All they wanted from us designers was a model of what something was supposed to look like on the outside, and then engineers would make it as cheap as possible. I was about to quit.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber149"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber149" class="calibre2">39</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_100"></a>Before Jony could quit, Jon Rubinstein, his new boss, talked him out of it. Just recruited as Apple’s head of hardware (the same job he’d held working with Steve Jobs at NeXT), Rubinstein gave Jony a raise and told him, going forward, things would be different.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We told him that we were going to struggle to get through where the company was then, and that once we turned the company around, we were going to make history. Those were the terms we used to keep him at Apple—and also that henceforth, design was going to be really valued at the company.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber150"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber150" class="calibre2">40</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rubinstein’s promise would be fulfilled. The era during which it took three years to get products out the door did end; in the coming years, the rate at which new products and new ideas were adopted—many of them from Jony Ive’s fertile brain—would be nothing less than remarkable.</p>
