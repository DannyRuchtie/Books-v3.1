			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">On January 27, 2010, Steve Jobs went public with Apple’s newest game changer. He announced the iPad at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, positioning it as a device that exists between an iPhone and a laptop, a highly portable, handheld slate with a touch-screen interface. He distinguished it from netbooks, describing the iPad as a device more “intimate than a laptop,” conveying the sense that the iPad was at the intersection of both technology and art.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPad went to market in April. In less than a month, Apple sold one million iPads in half the time it took the iPhone to reach that same mark. By June 2011, just over a year after its release, twenty-five million had been sold. By most measures it became the most successful consumer product launch in history. In 2011, shipments of iPads rapidly overtook those of netbooks, sixty-three million versus fewer than thirty million, according to research firm Canalys.<a id="SuperscriptNumber330"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber330" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At Apple HQ, some of the faces who initiated this growth were also changing. In November 2008, Tony Fadell had stepped down as senior vice president of the iPod division, the job he took over from Rubinstein. According to an Apple press release, Fadell and his wife, Danielle <a id="pageMap_238"></a>Lambert, who was vice president of the company’s human resources department, were “reducing their roles” to “devote more time to their young family.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber331"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber331" class="calibre2">7</a></sup> But two former Apple employees say Fadell was another victim of Jobs’s close relationship with Jony.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tony got canned,” said one source. “He was paid off with his salary for a number of years plus so many millions to leave. Tony was canned because he was battling with Jony. He went to Steve so many times bitching about Jony, but Steve had such a tremendous amount of respect for Jony and their relationship that he sided with Jony, not Tony.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber332"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber332" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
