			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">With new and gifted designers in place, the Apple IDg started working on a new design language for the company’s products. The aging Snow White language no longer suited the growing range of Apple products. The off-white or gray color schemes, with lots of horizontals on the enclosures, seemed ill adapted to the plethora of new printers, handhelds, speakers and portable CD players.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The team came up with what it called “Espresso,” a Euro-style aesthetic characterized by swooping organic shapes, bulges and an adventurous use of colored and textured plastics. Less a design language per se than a loose set of guidelines and best practices, Espresso was, in short, an aesthetic. There were no hard-and-fast rules. But, as has been said of pornography, the designers knew it when they saw it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Espresso name has two possible origins. The official story is that it was inspired by the minimalist design of the modern European coffee pots the group used while working. The unofficial (and more likely) story comes from Don Norman, head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group in the mid-1990s.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The name was a derogatory term applied to the new design team, who had just installed a fancy espresso coffee machine in the studio. One old-time engineer said it was a sign of the ‘yuppification’ of Apple, <a id="pageMap_84"></a>and started calling the team ‘espresso.’ The funny thing is, the designers didn’t get it and adopted the term for their new design language.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of the first Espresso products was the Macintosh Color Classic, an update of Steve Jobs’s original Mac, for which De Iuliis is given credit. Like the earlier Mac, it was an all-in-one machine, but De Iuliis lengthened its face, made the vents look like gills, gave it a higher forehead and made the floppy slot even more mouthlike. More bulbous and curvy than the original, the Mac Color Classic came out with a distinct personality. Enthusiastic users went crazy for it and turned the machine into a highly collectable machine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Its most distinctive Espresso touch was a pair of small, round legs at the front, which looked like the feet of a baby elephant. The fat feet tilted the computer upward by six degrees. As Don Norman put it, they gave the machine the look of “an eager pet staring up adoringly at its owner.” In fact, the feet were a kludge, the result of a lucky break. “Came from a fuck up,” explained Norman.<a id="SuperscriptNumber137"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber137" class="calibre2">27</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Early pizza box machine was about to go into production [and we] focused so much on making it slim and flat we forgot about the floppy slot on the front. Not enough room to insert a disk with a keyboard in front of the machine. So we added a pair of feet at the front that tilted the box up. Had the unexpected effect of giving the machine a lot of personality . . . [and it] became a design feature that was featured prominently for five years.” The look would influence a later generation of smash-hit products even after Jobs returned, as the iMac has its origins in Espresso.</p>
