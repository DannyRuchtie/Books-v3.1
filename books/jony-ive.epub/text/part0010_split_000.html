			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">The historical way of developing products just doesn’t work when you’re as ambitious as we are. When the challenges are that complex, you have to develop a product in a more collaborative, integrated way.<a id="SuperscriptNumber214" class="calibre2"></a><sup class="endnote1"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber214" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Steve Jobs loved the iMac, but as soon as it hit the market, he changed his mind about the color. In his typically binary fashion, he decided he hated the Bondi Blue. “I love the product but we’ve picked the wrong color,” he told the design team. “It’s not bright enough. There’s not enough life to it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber215"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber215" class="calibre2">2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony directed Doug Satzger, the design group’s official lead for color and materials, to start a new color investigation. Satzger was given two weeks to present new options. He found an unused room on Apple’s campus and assembled dozens of different-colored plastic items, among them kitchen flatware, transparent thermoses, brightly-colored plastic plates, just as the team had done for the Bondi Blue iMac. He arranged them by color: blue items on this table, red items on another. When he was ready, Satzger and a freelance contractor he was working with presented the results to Jony and Steve.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It didn’t go well.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Steve walks into the room and [says] there’s way too much stuff in there,” remembered Satzger. “He looks at me and he says, ‘You suck.’” Satzger could later laugh at the memory, but, at the time, it wasn’t funny. Jobs was anything but amused.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_139"></a>Jobs was upset because the choices were overwhelming. “We gave him way too much information, and it wasn’t focused on how we could apply it to the iMac. So he looks at me and says, ‘When can I see some colors on a product that’s similar to the iMac?’</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I asked for three weeks. Jony looked at me and was like ‘What? are you crazy?’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The task was daunting. In the allotted time, Satzger worked like a dog to come up with nearly complete models in a variety of new colors for Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“One great difficulty that we had was transferring opaque colors into transparency,” he said. “If you have a concept of a yellow, for instance, it is not very easy to make a transparent version of that yellow. What we did was take test tubes full of water and added food colors and other dyes to end up with fifteen different colors, which we took to the manufacturers to make. We did it that day, that day with Steve. And if their color house couldn’t make them we went to other manufacturers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The designers set to work building the cases and all their details, including CD drive lips, speaker enclosures, the back cover and the foot of the machine. A factory in China quickly built fifteen iMacs (with fake insides) in different colors.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger chose mature, rich colors: a deep blue, “Amber beer,” “Blue glue,” and “green leaf.” Amazingly, he met the deadline, three weeks to the day.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, my God,” said Jobs when he walked into a room full of colorful new iMacs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Steve walked in and looked at all the models,” Satzger recalled. “He took the yellow one, picked it up and placed it in the corner of the room, turned round and said, ‘It looks like piss. I don’t like yellow.’</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He chose some colors that he liked but then turned to us and said, ‘I really like these colors, they remind me of Life Savers. But there is still <a id="pageMap_140"></a>something missing—a color for the girls. I want to see a pink. When can I see a pink?’ So we went back again and created five different pinks in ten days, of which Steve approved one—Strawberry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was amazed at the speed with which Jobs gave his approval to the new colors. Jobs’s decisions meant five different cases would have to be made at the factory, and retailers would have five new SKUs to stock. But such logistics weren’t even discussed. The decision was driven purely by design: Steve Jobs wanted new colors. The logistics could be worked out later.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“In most places that decision would have taken months,” Jony later remarked. At the old Apple, too, executives would have stopped to ask questions about manufacturing and distribution—not now. “Steve did it in a half hour.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber216"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber216" class="calibre2">3</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The new multicolored iMacs—code-named Lifesavers—were put into production and hit the market in January 1999, just four months after the original iMac went on sale. The five colors were given consumer-friendly names: strawberry, blueberry, tangerine, lime and grape. Their arrival was a significant first as the multicolored iMacs introduced the concept of fashion to an industry previously preoccupied with speeds and feeds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Lifesaver Macs were the first in a long series of rapid upgrades to the iMac. Over the next several years, the iMac would get faster chips, bigger hard drives, wireless networking and—perhaps most important, though few realized this at the time—an even wider range of colors and designs. With the second-generation iMac, the color options were updated to graphite, ruby, sage, snow and indigo, with some patterned machines toward the end, including “Flower Power” and “Blue Dalmatian.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple would continue to sell multicolored iMacs until March 2003, when they were superseded by an even crazier design, the iMac G4 <a id="pageMap_141"></a>(which looked like a bulbous Luxo lamp). But for four years, the iMac launch and continuing development defined the game plan that Apple would use to such devastating effect with later products like the iPod: They created a breakthrough product, then quickly and relentlessly polished it with rapid new releases. The iMac was aggressively updated, not just with new technology, but new colors and price points. In five years, with variations in chip speeds and other hardware, there were at least thirty-two models in more than a dozen colors or patterns.</p>
