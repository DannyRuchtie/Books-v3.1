<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">The Iron Curtain</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jobs significantly beefed up security when the design studio moved onto the main campus. Because the studio is Apple’s ideas factory, Jobs wanted no leaks. He knew security was sometimes lax on Valley Green, and that visitors were occasionally buzzed in by whoever was around. Jobs was determined that wouldn’t be the case in the new location.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The vast majority of Apple’s employees are barred from the company’s design lab. Even some members of the executive team are forbidden from entering the studio. Scott Forstall, for example, who rose to be head of iOS software, wasn’t allowed to visit. His badge wouldn’t even open the door.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Few outsiders have been inside the studio. Jobs would occasionally bring in his wife. Walter Isaacson was given a tour, but he described only the presentation tables in his biography of Jobs. The only known photograph of the studio was published in <em class="calibre3">Time</em> magazine in October 2005.<a id="SuperscriptNumber243"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber243" class="calibre2">3</a></sup> The photo shows Jobs, Jony and three executives at the studio’s wooden project tables, the shop in the background.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There’s also some subtle subterfuge in the media with the ID studio. Jony occasionally gives interviews on Apple’s campus in an engineering <a id="pageMap_164"></a>workshop full of CNC milling machines. It’s been identified as the design studio, but it’s actually an engineering workshop nearby.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The secrecy extends well beyond physically protecting the products within Apple’s own studios. When working on new products, the software engineers have no idea what the hardware looks like and, conversely, the engineers have no idea how the software works. When Jony’s team was making prototypes for the iPhone, the designers worked with a picture of the home screen with dummy icons.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although all departments have their proprietary information, the secrecy is evidently tilted more in one direction. Apple’s most secretive department is Jony’s group. “It’s locked down,” said Satzger. “People know not to talk about their work and what was going on inside Apple to the wrong people.” Who are the “wrong people”? Essentially anyone but direct colleagues. Even Jony is forbidden from telling his wife what he’s working on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A former Apple engineer who worked closely with Jony’s group in the product design team said the secrecy could get exhausting. “Out of everything I’ve ever done in my life, I’ve never seen a more secret environment than working there,” he said. “We were constantly under threat of losing our jobs for revealing any shred of anything. And even within Apple, your neighbors often didn’t know what you were working on. . . . The secrecy was like a gun to your head. Make one false move and we’ll pull this trigger.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber244"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber244" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple’s obsessive secrecy has also meant that the designers have gotten almost no press and very little public recognition. They’ve won almost every award and are certainly admired in design circles, but to the general public, they remain largely anonymous. There’s surprisingly little resentment about the lack of credit. The team is used to it and Jony is gracious in sharing the recognition their products do receive. Though he typically gets the awards, he always talks about the team. As one <a id="pageMap_165"></a>observer wryly noted, the only time Jony says “I” is when he’s talking about the iPhone or iPad. The move is as much to shield the individuals on the team, however, as it is to give due praise. According to Rubinstein, “Although in the press Jony gets all the credit, in reality his whole team does a lot of work. . . . They all contribute tremendously with great ideas.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber245"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber245" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The design team doesn’t take offense at the lack of individual public praise. “We took it as, we’re all getting credit,” said Satzger. “[Apple] always says, ‘the Apple design team,’ but Steve never wanted us to be in front of the camera. They blocked headhunters and search people. Because we were blocked from facing media and hidden from headhunters and so on, we called ourselves the ‘ID Team that’s Behind the Iron Curtain.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber246"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber246" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the principal inventors at Apple, Jony and his group conceive and create new products, refine existing ones and do some fundamental R&amp;D, though they are not the only R&amp;D group in the company (there is no distinct R&amp;D department). The sixteen-odd designers focus on refining and improving Apple’s products and manufacturing processes. By comparison, Samsung has a thousand designers working in thirty-four research centers around the world. Of course, Samsung makes many more products than Apple (including some components for the iPhone and iPad).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Stringer describes the role of an industrial designer at Apple as “to imagine objects that don’t exist and to guide the process that brings them to life. And so that includes defining the experience that a customer has when they touch and feel our products. It’s managing the overall form and the materials, the textures, the colors. And it’s also working with engineering groups to, as I say, bring it to life, to bring it to the market and to building the craftsmanship that it absolutely needs to have to have that Apple quality.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber247"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber247" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_166"></a>Jony’s ID group has become a tightly knit team, as many of them have worked together for decades. They no longer design Apple’s products alone, but each product has a designated design lead, the designer who does most of the actual work, plus one or two deputies.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Weekly meetings ensure the design process is collaborative. Two or three times a week, Jony’s entire team gathers around the kitchen table for brainstorming sessions. All of the designers must be present. No exceptions. The sessions typically last for three hours, starting at nine or ten a.m.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The brainstorms begin with coffee. A couple of the designers play barista, making coffee for the group from a high-end espresso maker in the kitchen. Daniele De Iuliis, the Italian from the United Kingdom, is regarded as the coffee guru. “Danny D was the person who educated us all on coffee and grind and the color of the crema, how to properly do the milk, how temperature is important and all that stuff,” said Satzger, who was one of his keenest disciples.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When it’s time to get down to it, the brainstorms are freewheeling, creative roundtables where everyone is expected to contribute. Jony runs the brainstorms, but he doesn’t dominate them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony’s always been involved in every design session,” said one designer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The brainstorms are very focused. Sometimes it’s a model presentation, sometimes the detail of a button or speaker grille is discussed, or the group hashes out whatever design problem Jony’s group is working on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“[We] discuss our objectives, and so we can just be talking about what we would want a product to be,” said Stringer. “That ordinarily becomes sketching, so we’ll sit there with our sketch books and sketch and trade ideas and go back and forth. That’s where the very hard, <a id="pageMap_167"></a>brutal, honest criticism comes in and we thrash through ideas until we really feel like we’re getting something that’s worth modeling.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber248"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber248" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sketching is fundamental to their workflow. “I end up sketching everywhere,” said Stringer. “I’ll sketch on loose-leaf paper. I’ll sketch on models. I’ll sketch on anything I can put my hands on, quite often on top of CAD outputs for want of better things to do.” Stringer likes CAD printouts, he’s said, because they already have the shape of the product. “You’re working with something that already has the perspective set up and the views in a way that you can sort of add in lavish detail upon them,” he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber249"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber249" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony is also an inveterate sketcher. He is a good at it, but emphasizes speed over detail. “He always wanted to get a thought down on paper so that people could understand it really quickly,” said Satzger. “Jony’s drawings were really sketchy, with a shaky hand. His drawing style was really interesting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s sketchbooks are “really cool,” remembered Satzger, but he regards the artists of the group as Richard Howarth, Matt Rohrbach and Chris Stringer. “Richard Howarth would come in saying he had a crap idea and ‘you guys are going to hate it’ but then shared these amazing sketches.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the group was designing the iMac, the table was covered with loose sheets of copy paper for sketching on, but Jony’s group moved on to use sketchbooks, often hardbound volumes from Cachet by Daler-Rowney, a small British company. The studio’s office supply stockroom is stacked with them. With bindings made of high-quality canvas, they don’t fall to pieces. Howarth and Jony chose blue sketchbooks about three times as thick as the Cachet sketchbooks, with ribbon markers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The sketchbooks make it easy to go back and look at earlier ideas, which is vital, as the group’s practice is to document everything <a id="pageMap_168"></a>generated during a brainstorm. These sketchbooks would later became a contentious issue at the <em class="calibre3">Apple v. Samsung</em> trial.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A lot of sketching happens in these weekly sessions. At the end of the brainstorm, Jony will sometimes instruct everyone around the table to copy their sketchbooks and give the pages to the lead designer on the project under discussion; Jony will later sit with the lead designer and carefully go through all the pages. The lead and his two deputies will also pore through the pages trying to find ways to integrate new ideas.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Some days I’d be engaged and have ten pages of stuff,” Satzger remembered. “Sometimes you could feel when a designer wasn’t engaged in the material, when they weren’t filling up pages of things.”</p>
