			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">To help choose a name for the Columbus product, Jobs asked an old advertising buddy, Lee Clow from TBWA\Chiat\Day, to fly up from Los Angeles. Clow was accompanied by Ken Segall, one of his advertising executives. Jobs led them into a private room. In the middle of a conference table sat a big lump covered by a cloth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs whipped off the cloth to reveal a see-through plastic teardrop, the first Bondi Blue iMac. The ad men had never seen anything like it. They were stunned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We were pretty shocked but we couldn’t be frank,” Segall recalls. “We were guarded. We were being polite, but we were really thinking, ‘Jesus, do they know what they are doing?’ It was so radical.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber191"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber191" class="calibre2">41</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs told them that he was betting the company on the computer, so <a id="pageMap_129"></a>it needed a great name. He suggested “MacMan,” a name, Segall said, to “curdle your blood.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber192"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber192" class="calibre2">42</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The new computer was a Mac, Jobs said, so the name had to reference the Macintosh brand. The name had to make clear the machine was designed for the Internet. The name also had to be adaptable for several other upcoming products. And the name had to be found quickly, since the packaging needed to be ready in a week.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Segall came back with five names. Four were ringers, placeholders for the name he loved—iMac. “It referenced the Mac, and the ‘i’ meant internet,” Segall says. “But it also meant individual, imaginative, and all the other things it came to stand for.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Though Jobs rejected all five names, Segall refused to give up on iMac. He went back again with three or four new names, but again pitched iMac. This time, Jobs replied: “I don’t hate it this week, but I still don’t like it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber193"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber193" class="calibre2">43</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Segall heard nothing more about the name from Jobs personally, but friends told him that Jobs had the name silk-screened onto prototypes of the new computer, testing it out to see if he liked the look.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He rejected it twice but then it just appeared on the machine,” Segall recalled. He came to believe that Jobs changed his mind just because the lowercase “i” looked good on the product itself.<a id="SuperscriptNumber194"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber194" class="calibre2">44</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s a cool thing,” Segall remembered happily. “You don’t get to name too many products, and not ones that become so successful. It’s really great. I’m really delighted. It became the nomenclature for so many other products. Millions of people see that work.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber195"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber195" class="calibre2">45</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the last few years, the debate about dropping the “i” prefix has come up several times at Apple, Segall reported. “They’ve asked: ‘Should the company drop the ‘I’?’ But there’s a desire to keep it consistent: iMac, iPod, iPhone. It’s not as clean as it should be, but it works.”</p>
