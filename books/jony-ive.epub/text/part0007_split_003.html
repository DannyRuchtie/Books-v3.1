			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">A voracious reader, Jony’s tastes ran to books on design theory, the behaviorist B. F. Skinner and nineteenth-century literature.<a id="SuperscriptNumber76"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber76" class="calibre2">20</a></sup> A museum-goer, too, he and his dad had made many visits over the years to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, one of the world’s leading art and design museums.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He studied the work of Eileen Gray, one of the twentieth century’s most influential furniture designers and architects. Modern masters fascinated Jony, among them Michele De Lucchi, a member of Italy’s Memphis group, who tried to make high-tech objects easy to understand by making them gentle, humane and a bit friendly.<a id="SuperscriptNumber77"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber77" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer remembered Jony falling in love with furniture maker Jasper Morrison’s school of design, which was very architecturally pure, all straight lines with no curvaceous shapes. He was also fascinated by Dieter Rams, the legendary designer at Braun. “We were all inspired by Dieter Rams,” said Grinyer. “Rams’s design principles were implanted into us at design school—but we were not designing products that looked like Braun’s at Tangerine. Jony just liked the simplicity.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber78"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber78" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_45"></a>All four designers were interested in design philosophy, but Jony especially. Because Grinyer and Darbyshire were teaching, they were interested in trying to articulate what the firm’s design philosophy was. Both Grinyer and Darbyshire had done time with Bill Moggridge at ID Two/IDEO; he was a big influence on their style. One of the key lessons was adopting “no strong ideological viewpoint,” recalled Grinyer. Another key for Moggridge had been collaboration.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“IDEO had a consensus [system] so that everyone had to agree, and so Grinyer and Darbyshire were quite keen that when they did design work that everyone agreed on it. So they had a lot of reviews together about designs going forth, which was very good because it meant that you were testing yourself all the time,” Phillips said, “and that’s a really good way of doing it so that you are trying to please your client and at the same time you’re trying to push yourself, because you begin to feel yourself that this is something quite exciting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As for aesthetics, there were influences, but the Tangerine group never clung to a style for its own sake. “It was important for all of us, including Jony, that we were designing things for a reason,” said Grinyer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony was interested in getting things right and fit for a purpose. He was completely interested in humanizing technology. What something should be was always the starting point for his designs. He had the ability to remove, or ignore, how any product currently is, or how an engineer might say it must be. He could go back to basics on any product design, or user interface design. And we all shared this similar philosophy at Tangerine. It was not so much due to our formal design education, but more a reaction to seeing the ways that other people were designing.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber79"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber79" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Jony, this represented a shift. At college, his projects had showed the beginnings of a design language, or at least a signature style, as most were in white plastic. But at Tangerine, Jony went out of his way not to put a particular stamp on his work. “Unlike most of his generation, Ive <a id="pageMap_46"></a>did not see design as an occasion to exert his ego or carry out some pre-ordained style or theory,” wrote Paul Kunkel, who interviewed Jony in detail for his book, <em class="calibre3">AppleDesign</em>, a look at Apple’s design department in the 1980s. “Rather, he approached each project in an almost chameleon-like way, adapting himself to the product (rather than the other way around) . . . For this reason, Ive’s early works have no ‘signature style.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber80"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber80" class="calibre2">24</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then, as now, Jony’s aesthetic tended toward minimalism, in reaction perhaps to the mid-1980s tendencies for excess. That had been the height of the “designer decade,” when the splashy colors of Culture Club and Kajagoogoo represented good taste. According to Kunkel, Jony avoided styling his products to protect them from dating too quickly. “In an era of rapid change, Ive understood that style has a corrosive effect on design, making a product seem old before its time. By avoiding style, he found that his designs could not only achieve greater longevity, he could focus instead on the kind of authenticity in his work that all designers aspire to, but rarely achieve.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was not alone. Grinyer, Darbyshire and Phillips were minimalists, too, as were a growing number of other design firms. There was a global wave of minimalism, adopted by Tangerine and picked up by other designers, among them Naoto Fukasawa in Japan and Sam Hecht, another Saint Martins graduate, who worked on a lot of design for “no-brand, high-quality” Muji, the consumer and household products manufacturer. “In the contemporary culture of the 1980s, there was the cliché of the over-designed environment, where everything was a riot of color and form,” explained Professor Alex Milton. “It was a visual overload. Objects shouted at you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“[Jony] graduated in this period where there was a lot of over-design. Objects did not impart any of their owner’s personality. They were brands. And so designers wanted to become cooler, calmer, more reflective, and return to a sense of functionalism and utilitarianism.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_47"></a>Darbyshire expressed Tangerine’s basic thinking this way: “We were trying to make things genuinely better, giving thought to the visual quality, usability and market relevance of all that we designed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer contrasted this approach to the work at other agencies, which tried to put their signature on their commissions. “When I was with Bill Moggridge, I saw lots of really good designers who could only design a particular sort of office-based industrial product,” he said. “When they tried to apply their same aesthetic to more mass-market, everyday products, they really failed. They came up with oddly techno products. And that puzzled me. I thought that design should be able to speak in different languages according to each specific purpose.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Advances in manufacturing technology allowed Jony and his colleagues to gently push the envelope. “The 1990s were a time when we were beginning to be able to decorate products,” Grinyer said. “Their form could be more interesting. It was no longer just about cladding electronics and putting the button in the right place. We could bring in more shapes, exploit the fluidity offered by injection molding plastics. We could create things that were actually beautiful rather than simply functional.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Again, this had a potential downside, which Grinyer witnessed firsthand working at IDEO. “Designers would often come up with merely a shape,” he said. “They did not think about the different functionality of, say, a computer screen and a television. I thought that was a mistake. We did not want to make something that was merely a beautiful shape. We wanted our designs to fit into people’s homes. And we were very much focused on the user interface of products.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For his part, Jony took an independent view: His priority seemed always to be the creation of objects that were beautiful rather than simply functional. He was constantly questioning how things should be. “He hated ugly, black and tacky electronics,” recalled Grinyer. “He hated computers having names like ZX75 and numbers of megabytes. <a id="pageMap_48"></a>He hated technology as it was in the 1990s.” At a time of big changes in design, Jony looked to find his own way.</p>
