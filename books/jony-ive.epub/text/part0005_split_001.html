			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Mike Ive’s influence reached well beyond the precocious child in his own household. For many years, he worked as a silversmith and teacher in Essex. Described by one colleague as a “gentle giant,” he was well liked and much admired for his workmanship.<a id="SuperscriptNumber1"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber1" class="calibre2">2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His skill at making things led to his initial decision to teach handicraft as a career, but a later rise in the educational hierarchy afforded him wider influence. Mike was among the distinguished teachers plucked from daily teaching by the Education Ministry and given the grand title of Her Majesty’s Inspector. He assumed responsibility for <a id="pageMap_3"></a>monitoring the quality of teaching at schools in his district, focusing specifically on design and technology.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the time, British schools were trying to improve vocational education. A widening chasm lay between academic subjects and hands-on subjects like design, and the latter classes in woodwork, metalwork and cooking—in effect, shop-class subjects—were accorded low status and limited resources. Worse yet, with no accepted standards of teaching, as one former teacher put it, the schools “were able practically to teach what they wanted.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber2"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber2" class="calibre2">3</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Mike Ive took what came to be called design technology (DT) to a new level, establishing a place for the discipline as a part of the core curriculum in UK schools.<a id="SuperscriptNumber3"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber3" class="calibre2">4</a></sup> In the forward-looking design and technology curriculum Mike helped devise, the emphasis shifted from shop skills to an integrated course that mixed academics with making things.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He was way ahead of his time as an educator,” said Ralph Tabberer, a former colleague and schoolteacher, who would become the director general of schools in Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government in the new century. Mike helped write the mandatory curriculum that became the blueprint for all UK schools, as England and Wales became the first countries in the world to make design technology education available for all children between the ages of five and sixteen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Under his influence, DT went from being a marginal subject to something that occupied seven to ten percent of students’ time at school,” said Tabberer. Another of Mike Ive’s former colleagues, Malcolm Moss, characterized Mike’s contribution to the teaching of design technology: “Mike gained a reputation for being a compelling advocate for DT.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber4"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber4" class="calibre2">5</a></sup> In practice, that meant Mike helped transform what was basically a goof-off class into a design tutorial and, in doing so, laid the groundwork for a generation of gifted British designers. His son would be among them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_4"></a>Tabberer remembers Mike Ive talking about Jony’s progress in school and his growing passion for design. But Mike wasn’t a pushy stage dad, trying to turn his son into a prodigy like the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. “Mike’s influence on his son’s talent was purely nurturing,” said Tabberer. “He was constantly talking to Jonathan about design. If they were walking down the street together, Mike might point out different types of street lamps in various locations and ask Jonathan why he thought they were different: how the light would fall and what weather conditions might affect the choice of their designs. They were constantly keeping up a conversation about the built environment and what made-objects were all around them . . . and how they could be made better.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber5"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber5" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mike was a person who had a quiet strength about him and was relentlessly good at his job,” added Tabberer. “He was a very gentle character, very knowledgeable, very generous and courteous. He was a classic English gentleman.” These traits, of course, have also been ascribed to Jony.</p>
