			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After the success of the iMac, Jobs and his A team set about filling the three empty quadrants in his 2×2 product road map. With a consumer desktop on the market, they still needed a professional desktop and portables for consumers and professionals. These machines, released over the next couple of years, allowed the company to grow and the design team to be more ambitious in pioneering new technologies, materials and manufacturing methods.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Jony’s design team, the iMac was succeeded by an assignment to create a powerful desktop computer for professional users, in particular photo editors, video editors and scientists. They were the remnants of Apple’s old user base—creative professionals associated with the desktop publishing segment—who, having helped establish Apple during the late 1980s and early 1990s, stayed committed to the company and kept it afloat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_144"></a>The Power Mac G3 brought the iMac design language to a tower design. Known as the “Blue and White” Power Mac, it sported a blue and white plastic case. Again, the designers incorporated a handle or, more accurately, handles, as there was one on each corner. In the case of the G3, the handles were actually designed to move the machine (rather than to make it less intimidating to users), and they were consistent with Jony’s new design language.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The G3 was a quiet success. It never attracted the attention or adulation of the iMac, but it sold in respectable numbers and maintained Apple’s presence in the business market, which at the time was more important than the consumer sector.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In design terms, its successor was more interesting. The Power Mac G4 tower was based around the PowerPC “G4” chip. Apple referred to the Power Mac G4 as “not only the fastest Mac ever” but also “the fastest personal computer ever.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber222"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber222" class="calibre2">9</a></sup> The gray case also represented an interim step toward the aluminum that later came to dominate Apple’s professional line.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Initially, the Power Mac G4 tower was slate gray graphite, subsequently replaced by a dazzling metallic “quicksilver” case. Satzger remembered working on the quicksilver case, which taught him an important lesson about the new Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the last minute before the machine went to production, there had been a change in various hardware features, as well as in the color of the case. In the rush to build it, there was a color mismatch between the doors on the front face and the rest of the case. Jobs, of course, didn’t like it. Satzger pushed back, saying that there wasn’t time to fix it. According to Satzger, “Steve said simply, ‘Don’t you think you owe it to yourself and to me, to do better?’ I said yes and we went back and did it again, and it was better. It was always better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The quicksilver case was also the cause of a big fight between Jony <a id="pageMap_145"></a>and Rubinstein. Jony wanted special screws on the handles that had a particular shape and finish. But Rubinstein said the cost would be “astronomical” and would delay the machine’s delivery. Delivering products on time was Rubinstein’s responsibility, and so he vetoed Jony’s screws. But Jony went over Rubinstein’s head to Jobs and around him to the engineers in product design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ruby [Rubinstein] would say, ‘You can’t do this, it will delay,’ and I would say, ‘I think we can.’ And I would know, because I had worked behind his back with the product teams,” Jony later recalled.<a id="SuperscriptNumber223"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber223" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The argument over screws illustrated a growing rift between Jony and Rubinstein. Over the next several years, their clashes would become more frequent and more fraught.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“[Jony’s] focus was design,” said Rubinstein, speaking by phone in 2012. “Design was all he cared about. And so although design is extremely important, we also had to tackle electrical engineering, manufacturing, service and support. There are many different constituencies that all had a voice—not necessarily a vote, but a voice—and my job was to balance everybody’s needs. And at some point, compromises always had to be made.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber224"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber224" class="calibre2">11</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not in this case, though. Jony got his way: The screws on the G4 were made from highly polished stainless steel.</p>
