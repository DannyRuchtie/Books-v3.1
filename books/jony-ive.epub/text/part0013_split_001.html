			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">His role at Apple assured, Jony indulged his old passion for cars. He treated himself to an Aston Martin DB9, a supercar known for its association with James Bond. Jony had the car delivered to New York and drove it cross-country with his dad, Mike. It cost about $250,000, but just a month after he got it, Jony wrecked the car on Interstate 280 near San Bruno. The accident nearly killed him and his commuting partner, Daniele De Iuliis, who was riding in the passenger seat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony was going pretty fast, although he said he was not going over eighty miles per hour,” said a colleague. “Something happened in the traffic. Jony lost control of the car, which went into a spin. It sling-shotted the back end, whacked into a panel truck and knocked that over, and went straight into the median. The whole car was smashed. They were lucky to get out alive. The car was a mess; totally fucked up on all sides.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The car’s airbags went off, filling the car with the smell of the explosive that set off the airbags. Jony found the smell unsettling as he came to. “He woke up with the smell of gunpowder in the car and that was weird. He was distressed by that,” said another source. “Ironically, the car crash alerted Apple to how important Jony is to the company, and they gave him a big pay rise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was undeterred in his quest for speed and cool cars: He bought a second DB9. When it burst into flames parked outside his garage, he complained to Aston Martin. “Him being English and his relationship with Steve and Apple, he went to Aston Martin and they told him they’d give him a great deal,” said a source.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The company offered him a discount to move up to the Vanquish (2004–2005 model), a $300,000 grand touring car with a monstrous V12 engine. Soon after, Jony bought a white Bentley, another powerful British luxury car. He also purchased a Land Rover LR3 after one of his <a id="pageMap_193"></a>colleagues in the design studio bought one. “Jony wanted one as well and got one within days,” said a source. Later, Jony added a black Bentley Brooklands to his stable. Costing about $160,000, the Brooklands was hand assembled with lots of interior wood and leather. It’s another powerful machine, capable of reaching sixty miles per hour from a standing stop in five seconds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As well as being fast and powerful, Aston Martins are known for their innovative production methods. Their cars are built from unusual, lightweight materials like aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber. The all-aluminum chassis is glued together rather than welded, which makes it incredibly strong and resistant to cracking. Jony would soon introduce similar production methods to Apple’s manufacturing arsenal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Starting with the iMac G3, Jobs and Jony worked together more closely than ever. Ken Segall, the TBWA/Chiat/Day ad man, who continued to consult with Apple, reported that “[Jony] was in most of our biweekly meetings with Steve.” These were marketing meetings—not Jony’s thing—yet Jobs liked him there to bounce ideas off. “Steve obviously valued Jony’s thinking for more than just product design.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His role as consigliere was cemented by their relationship outside the conference room as well. Segall also remembered: “Steve and Jony having lunch in the cafeteria—and not once in all that time did I ever see Steve there without Jony. They seemed truly inseparable.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber277"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber277" class="calibre2">10</a></sup> Meanwhile, Jony’s relationship with Rubinstein was worsening. They fought constantly over everything.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the wake of the first iPod release, it became evident that Jony’s role in shaping Apple’s philosophy had grown. His belief that computers and music players should be simple to use and beautiful to look at drove many decisions not only in the evolution of the iPod but in the release of new models of the iMac and iBook.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_194"></a>“Apple puts out something really elegant like the [iPod]. Then they relentlessly improve it,” said Dennis Boyle, one of the cofounders of IDEO. “So not only are they outstanding at putting true innovations onto the market, but also at making those products better and better. . . . They leave their competitors in the dust.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber278"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber278" class="calibre2">11</a></sup> Within two years of launch, the iPod was made Windows compatible (it would have been quicker, but acquiescing to Windows was a big psychological barrier for Jobs), and gained the iTunes Music Store, which made it an easy matter to load the player with new content.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In continuing the process of miniaturization, which had shrunk all of the iPod’s components, the iPod mini hit the market in January 2004 with a smaller, solid-state click wheel that was touch-sensitive. The buttons at the four compass points were incorporated into the wheel itself. “The click wheel was designed out of necessity for the mini because there wasn’t enough room for [the buttons on] the full size iPod,” said Jobs. “But the minute we experienced it, we just thought, ‘Oh my God! Why didn’t we think of this sooner?’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber279"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber279" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony offered a more detailed version of the mini’s development. Originally conceived as a small iPod, the first versions, which used the same materials and design language, weren’t working. “It was just completely wrong,” Jony said. “Then we started to explore very different materials and approaches. We realized we could make this in aluminum. Unlike with stainless steel, you could blast it and then anodize it—which is a form of dyeing—and then you could do color in an unusual way.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber280"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber280" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That first foray into aluminum would influence a whole generation of products. Like the iMac before it, the iPod mini would come in a range of colors. It was a big hit; the fastest-selling iPod up to that time, especially with women. It was the first iPod that people started wearing on their bodies, outside their pockets, with a strap or a clip. Some <a id="pageMap_195"></a>treated it like an accessory, a piece of fashion jewelry. The mini also kick-started the trend of having a small, dedicated iPod just for the gym or running.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In just four years, Apple took the iPod from the 6.4 oz. original to the 4.8 oz. nano. In the process, storage was increased sixfold, a color screen and video playback were added and battery life was extended to four hours. And the price was reduced by $100. Eventually, Apple was selling a player at every $50 price point between $50 and $550, including the shuffle, which dispensed with the screen, an exercise in ballsy minimalism that perhaps only Jony and Jobs could have pulled off.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some of the gains were a function of manufacturing improvements. In an interview with the British edition of <em class="calibre3">GQ</em>, Jony expounded upon the advances he’d achieved with the first aluminum shuffle. Machined from extruded aluminum, the shuffle clipped together with barely a gap between the parts. “The way the parts fit together is extraordinarily tight,” Jony said. “I don’t think there’s ever been a product produced in such volume at that price, which has been given so much time and care.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber281"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber281" class="calibre2">14</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The world was taking notice not only of Apple’s products but of the company’s talented head designer. Jony had been winning prizes and awards since his teens, but in the early 2000s, the awards really poured in. In July 2002, the Industrial Designers Society of America honored Jony and Apple with the design world’s highest honors, the gold Industrial Design Excellence Award (IDEA) for the original iPod, declaring the music player “the most memorable design solution” of the year.<a id="SuperscriptNumber282"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber282" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In June 2003, the London Design Museum announced that Jony was the winner of its inaugural Designer of the Year Award. His prize was £25,000, plus a golden gong. The distinction seemed a foregone conclusion. “Designer of the Year doesn’t really come close to describing what Ive has achieved in the decade since he joined Apple,” wrote Marcus <a id="pageMap_196"></a>Fairs in <em class="calibre3">ICON</em> magazine. “There are few designers who have had the commercial, critical and sociological impact of Ive and his small team at Apple.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber283"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber283" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony took every opportunity to include his colleagues at awards ceremonies, a clear acknowledgment that the work he was being celebrated for was always a group effort. At the London Design Museum he was joined at the party by his design group, who paid him the compliment of dressing “exactly like Ive, had crewcuts like Ive, and said as little as Ive,” said <em class="calibre3">ICON</em>. Jony told reporters he found awards “nice” but “slightly awkward in that it’s a hard thing to receive when there’s a team of you.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber284"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber284" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“One of the great things about our team, about working so closely together,” Jony added, “is the feeling that we’re really only at the beginning of something, that we have only just started. We still have lots more to do.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber285"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber285" class="calibre2">18</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s and Apple’s success was quite obvious. As he noted on a trip to London, everywhere he looked, he saw the white earbuds. Having labored for years when Apple had just a small share of the computer market, he found it gratifying to see one of his designs become dominant.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jonathan Glancey, design critic for the <em class="calibre3">Guardian</em>, said Jony’s genius had been “to make imaginative what was previously lackluster, to give a glamorous, desirable and human face to a technology that has been . . . the domain of joyless office managers and electronic professionals (transforming) a humourless technology into something desirable and sophisticated.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber286"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber286" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Canada’s <em class="calibre3">Saturday Post</em> called the iPod “the defining device of this generation’s iWant-iNeed-iWish gadgetophiles.” Its ubiquity and “no beige please, we’re British” design philosophy granted it permanent icon status.<a id="SuperscriptNumber287"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber287" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Toward the end of the year, Jony’s growing reputation was <a id="pageMap_197"></a>recognized by the government of his native England. On the heels of the cultural era known as “Cool Britannia,” Prime Minister Gordon Brown called out Jony as a model for English design innovation. The <em class="calibre3">Guardian</em> reported that Brown sought to use the nation’s large number of design graduates “to make [UK] products more desirable than low-cost competition, and thus fend off the challenge from China and India.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber288"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber288" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the mid-nineties, according to the report, one in sixty-four graduates were in design programs. A decade later, the number was one in sixteen. “Design is not incidental to modern economies but integral; not a part of success but the heart of success; and not a sideshow but the centrepiece,” Brown said. His government commissioned official reports to find the economic potential of design in its industries and found that design-centered companies “saw a turnover rise by fourteen percent and profits by nine percent.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber289"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber289" class="calibre2">22</a></sup> No doubt Jony’s father, Mike, had made a huge contribution to the rise of design in his native land and he was honored thusly. In 1999, in recognition of his contributions to British design education, Mike Ive was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 2003, Jony was appointed a member of Royal Designers for Industry; in 2004, he was awarded the RSA Benjamin Franklin Medal; and in 2005, he won what was to be the first in a string of prestigious awards from the British Design &amp; Art Direction (D&amp;AD). In 2006, he was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire (a higher award than his father’s OBE).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony didn’t make a public comment about the award at the time, but in a statement, Apple said: “We are as proud as could be that Jony is receiving such a prestigious commendation.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber290"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber290" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Although his designs were drawing much notice, bigger work (quite literally) was still ahead. The year 2003 saw the release of the <a id="pageMap_198"></a>seventeen-inch PowerBook. It was a monster laptop, but none of Apple’s marketing materials mentioned Jony’s proudest innovations, which included its internal frame and a clutch mechanism in the lid hinge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The variable-rate clutch he devised had less resistance in the near-closed position, allowing the lid to be opened with one hand without the bottom of the laptop lifting off the desk. A consuming attention to detail contributed to the user experience, even though few users have any idea how much work went into it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was proud of the PowerBook’s construction, and dismantled one for his 2003 Designer of the Year exhibition at the Design Museum. “We took [it] to pieces so you can see our preoccupation with a part of the product that you’ll never see,” Jony said. “I think—I hope—there’s an inherent beauty in the internal architecture of the product and the way we’re fabricating the product: laser-welding different gauges of aluminium together and so on. Very often people assume that it’s only if it’s a smaller volume production—batch production—that people will really be caring about all of the details. I think one thing that is typical about our work at Apple is caring about the smallest details. I think sometimes that’s seen as more of a craft activity than a mass-production one. But I think that’s very important.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber291"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber291" class="calibre2">24</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Richard Powell, founder and director of the famous design firm Seymourpowell, liked what he saw. “When you talk to Jony Ive, his eyes sparkle with the memory of a design challenge overcome, a problem solved, a material found. He becomes animated about a surface perfected and a process explored. For Ive, nothing is left to chance; everything must be deeply considered.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber292"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber292" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Powell saw Jony’s focus as defining. “Innovation,” he wrote, “is rarely about a big idea; more usually it’s about a series of small ideas brought together in a new and better way. Jony’s fanatical drive for excellence is, I think, most evident in the stuff beyond the obvious; the stuff you <a id="pageMap_199"></a>perhaps don’t notice that much, but which makes a difference to how you interact with the product, how you feel about it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The iPod was becoming a monster hit, suddenly as important to Apple as the Mac line. In 2004, the iPod was spun off into a separate division and Rubinstein, formerly head of all hardware, put in charge. In executive meetings, Jobs and his team started wondering what else the company might get into. An Apple-branded car and digital cameras were some of the ideas knocked around.<a id="SuperscriptNumber293"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber293" class="calibre2">26</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 2005, Jobs promoted Jony to senior vice president of industrial design, elevating him to the same senior level as Rubinstein. Jony had reported to Rubinstein, with whom he fought constantly. Now Jony answered only to Jobs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and Ruby had been getting into regular shouting matches. Jony was always pushing the envelope, constantly challenging how things were made and designed. It was Rubinstein’s job to get products out the door, and he frequently balked at Jony’s demands. According to a former designer who worked with the pair, Rubinstein avoided Jony and the studio as much as possible and, if he did have to meet with Jony, he became visibly agitated. “Jon’s blood would just boil whenever he had to go into the studio and deal with Jony,” said one source.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The relationship was equally problematic for Jony. The confrontation that had been brewing for years finally happened. Jony reportedly went to Jobs and told him, “It’s him or me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite Rubinstein’s essential role in the development of the iPod and scores of other products, Jobs chose Jony.<a id="SuperscriptNumber294"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber294" class="calibre2">27</a></sup> In October 2005, Apple issued a press release that framed Rubinstein’s exit as a long-deserved retirement. He was replaced as head of the iPod division by Tony Fadell.<a id="SuperscriptNumber295"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber295" class="calibre2">28</a></sup> Rubinstein would spend some time building a house in Mexico before later becoming CEO of Palm and developing a rival to the iPhone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_200"></a>Speaking of the affair years later, Rubinstein was diplomatic about his relationship with Jony. “Jony and I worked very closely over many years and did a lot of work together. My job was to instill balance and get products out the door. Sometimes working with Jony could be difficult.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber296"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber296" class="calibre2">29</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even if they had their hard moments, during their shared time at Apple, Jony and his then-superior Rubinstein steered the company’s design language through several phases, moving from multicolored plastic to monochrome plastic and on to a range of metals. Importantly, each stage marked a growing sophistication in the tandem of design and manufacturing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That the manufacturing methods became a larger and larger part of the design process undoubtedly added to the tension between the two men. The design team was no longer concerned with merely how the products looked and worked. Their brief became how the products were made, and Jony’s team, which had always spent a lot of time designing products, invested more and more time in figuring out how to manufacture them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Former design team leader Bob Brunner gave his view on the travails: “Apple designers spend ten percent of their time doing traditional industrial design: coming up with ideas, drawing, making models, brainstorming. They spend ninety percent of their time working with manufacturing, figuring out how to implement their ideas.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber297"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber297" class="calibre2">30</a></sup> It’s little wonder, then, than Jony’s star was ascendant in a company where design and materials had become the industrial equivalent of conjoined twins.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s outlook on the cost of R&amp;D and development work was simple: He didn’t want to know about it. As he told a former engineer who worked in the operations group, “I do not want any of my guys thinking about cost. They should not even care about the cost because that is not their job.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_201"></a>To some in the company, it seemed as if Jony reported to no one, not even Jobs. Reportedly he told suppliers, “Imagine I have a bucket of money in my hand. I will let you pull out as much as you want to make this happen,” said the operations engineer. Discussions between Jony’s group and product development and operations tended to go in one direction, from the designers to production.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the operations executive summed it up, “ID rules Apple.”</p>
