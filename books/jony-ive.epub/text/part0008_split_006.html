<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_6">Bye-bye, Brunner</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Just before the release of Twentieth Anniversary Mac, Brunner quit. He went to join Pentagram, the prestigious international design firm founded in London, which had courted him earlier that year.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner’s resignation had been in the cards for months. Early in 1996, he had taken an extended leave of absence. Though he returned that fall, things had gone from bad to worse within Apple and the design department. Everyone was frustrated. Two other longtime designers announced they were leaving before Brunner took his departure in December.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The decisive factor in his leaving was undoubtedly the Twentieth Anniversary Mac. After all the battles to get it to market, Brunner believed bungled positioning and pricing led to the machine’s failure. “It was never intended to be a special edition thing,” said Brunner. “It was intended to be higher-end but a mainstream product. . . . [I]t was a <a id="pageMap_93"></a>very provocative, forward-looking design, and it foretold what was coming six or seven years later.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">More important, Brunner said, the process—fraught and hard fought as it had been—represented a line in the sand from the design group, an attempt to change Apple’s internal culture. “That was when we as a design group said we are not going to be a service to other parts of the organization. We are going to take these ideas and push them forward on our own. It pissed people off but it also opened people’s eyes up to what a truly design-driven process can do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the failure of the anniversary Mac indicated, Apple had become dysfunctional; it was a struggle to get products out, and there were constant battles with engineers and executives. “I quit for two reasons,” explained Brunner. “One, the job wasn’t fun, and to be brutally honest I was losing interest in it. I was spending more and more time in management meetings where I would be there for eight hours and only really needed to be there for thirty minutes. You feel like you are atrophying, you are wasting away. I’m not the kind of person that can just do the job even though you fucking hate it. Can’t do it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With Brunner’s departure, Apple faced growing chaos. There was pressure once again to conduct a search for a name-brand designer, just like the company had done five years earlier. Brunner advised against looking outside for their next design leader. Most of the design team would depart, he warned, and besides, Apple already had a superstar. The job should go to his deputy, Jony Ive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He had quiet leadership qualities and he was super respected,” said Brunner. “Not to put the other guys down at all, for me there was no other choice.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For some at Apple, Jony’s age and inexperience were at issue. He was only twenty-nine, but Brunner recommended Jony because he admired <a id="pageMap_94"></a>his quiet commitment. “He was very consistent, very strong, and he was very ambitious,” said Brunner. “Not in the wear-it-on-your-sleeve kind of ambition that many people have, but he was very strong and insistent. I’m going to do this, and I’m going to do it well.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most of all, Jony had what Brunner called “the full spectrum mentality.” He saw the big picture and the details.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony is very much the craftsman,” Brunner explained. “He loves the big picture but he also revels in the details, being in the factory and knowing exactly where every screw goes. . . . I just knew he had the qualities to be successful.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In other words, Jony had what it took to succeed in a corporate environment. He was willing to sit through the endless meetings and battle middle managers to get his designs made.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It would have been a disaster if they had hired a headhunter and hired a guy that had a name and offered him a ton of money,” Brunner said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony got the job. “It was probably one of the better recommendations I ever made,” Brunner said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jony inherited a legacy at Apple that would help him thrive. “The Brunner era (1990–95) was by far the most productive and interesting period in Apple’s design history,” Paul Kunkel would write in <em class="calibre3">AppleDesign</em>. “IDg became the most visible and prestigious corporate design group in the world, won more design awards than the rest of the computer industry combined and reached a level where further improvement meant using its own work as a yardstick rather than the competition’s.” A string of successful and groundbreaking products set the template for the future, including the PowerBook (which anticipated today’s MacBooks); the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (the flat-screen iMac); and the Newton, which was a crude precursor to the iPhone and iPad.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_95"></a>Perhaps even more important, Brunner built the studio, hired great talent and set up the culture. “Bob did more than lay the foundations for Jony’s design team at Apple—he built the castle,” said Clive Grinyer. “After Bob, it was the first time that an in-house design team was cool.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber142"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber142" class="calibre2">32</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No design slouch himself, Brunner became a partner in the San Francisco office of Pentagram in 1996. He worked with Amazon on the original Kindle, and with Nike and Hewlett-Packard, among many others. In 2007, Brunner helped create the Beats by Dr. Dre brand of headphones, which have been a mega success. In mid-2007, Brunner founded Ammunition, a design consultancy in San Francisco, where he’s worked with Barnes &amp; Noble, Polaroid and Williams-Sonoma. He’s won a ton of awards, and his work is included in the permanent collections of both the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But Brunner likes to joke that the only thing he’ll be remembered for is bringing Jony to Apple. “When I die, my tombstone is going to say: ‘The Guy Who Hired Jonathan Ive!’”</p>
