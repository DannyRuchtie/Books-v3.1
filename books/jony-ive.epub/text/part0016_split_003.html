			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The new manufacturing methods are driven partly by Jony’s desire to make Apple greener. Those desires got a kick start in 2005, when Apple got into a public spat with Greenpeace International. The global environmental campaigner slammed Apple for its lack of a recycling program and its use of a host of toxic chemicals in its manufacturing processes. Steve Jobs dismissed the charges at first but, in 2007, announced a total overhaul of Apple’s environmental practices. Since then the company has improved its environmental profile, reducing toxins in manufacturing, including mercury, arsenic, brominated flame retardants and polyvinyl chloride.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In a further attempt to improve its environmental profile, Apple lowered power requirements of many products, earning high Energy Star ratings and gold ratings from the Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool (EPEAT), which tries to measure products’ environmental impact over their lifetime, taking into account energy use, recyclability and how the products are designed and made. Apple has also reduced the size of its packaging, permitting more packages to be loaded into freight and saving fuel. And the newest MacBooks are touted as 100 percent recyclable, while Apple products in general use aluminum and glass, materials that are easily recycled and reused.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even so, Apple still doesn’t get the highest marks from Greenpeace because the company is so secretive. In 2012, Greenpeace gave Apple a score of 4.5 out of a possible 10, putting Apple in the middle of the pack of tech companies (an improvement, actually, as it started at the bottom). Overall, Greenpeace credits Apple with increased environment responsibility but points out that “Apple misses out on points for lack of transparency on GHG [greenhouse gas] emission reporting, clean energy advocacy, further information on its management of toxic chemicals, and details on post-consumer recycled plastic use.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber347"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber347" class="calibre2">11</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_249"></a>Although Jobs got public credit for the greening of Apple, one source inside the company said a lot of the impetus came from Jony, who was “really stung” by Greenpeace’s initial criticism.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony felt that Apple had very positive stories about its environmental impact,” the source said. Jony’s commitment to not making junk products certainly puts him in a stronger environmental light: His products tend to be used and cherished for years, just the opposite of throwaway products with their more immediate and detrimental environmental impact.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another criticism cast at Jony and the company concerns the decision to seal many of their products. That means that, in most cases, Apple products aren’t user serviceable, as they require special tools and skills even to change a battery. Environmental activists like Kyle Wiens of iFixit point out a sealed device is more likely to be junked than one that can be more easily repaired by the nonprofessional.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPad, Wiens said, is “deeply immoral. It’s glued shut and the battery will be inoperable after five hundred charge-discharge cycles. It is expressly designed to be thrown away. Reparability isn’t a concern and so designers aren’t going to design that in.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber348"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber348" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple insiders disagree. They point out Apple’s products are certainly designed to be repaired, though not by their owners. “Apple has a special service process,” Satzger explained. “Not a lot of other companies have the ability to service their own products, so they design them to be serviced by places like Best Buy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger argued that that means Apple equipment is in fact more serviceable. “For repair work, Apple takes back all its products and handles servicing through the company’s stores. Repairs and servicing are taken into account from the outset of a product’s design. . . . Apple’s service process is exquisitely refined for their own products.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber349"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber349" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_250"></a>Apple, as one of the world’s richest and most powerful companies, has clearly taken a leadership role in manufacturing. If their commitment to their global workforce and to environmental concerns remains less certain, it’s clear that Jony Ive will have a voice in shaping those policies into the foreseeable future.</p>
