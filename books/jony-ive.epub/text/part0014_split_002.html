<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_2">A New Team Takes Charge</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">After the decision to move forward with the P2, Jony was put in charge of industrial design, Fadell of engineering and Forstall, previously <a id="pageMap_219"></a>responsible for Mac OS X, was given the job of adapting the computer operating system into a brand-new operating system for the phone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s design team worked on the iPhone without ever seeing the operating system. They initially worked with a blank screen and later, a picture of the interface with cryptic mock icons. Likewise, the software engineers never got to see the prototype hardware. “I still don’t know what the lightning icon means,” one of the designers later remarked, referring to one of the icons on the fake iOS screen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony himself wasn’t left in the dark: He was kept up to speed on the latest developments in Forstall’s new operating system, and was constantly talking to Jobs and other executives. He’d give feedback and direction to the design team. Within the design studio, designer Richard Howarth was designated the design lead of the P2.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the beginning, few of those involved were confident they would be able to develop a phone. “It was fundamental R&amp;D in all directions,” said a former executive. It meant ramping up probably the most difficult project in the company’s history and, all the while, continuing to develop products like the MacBook and the iPod line. Important staffers were moved off their current projects, delaying some products and canceling others.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were potentially dire consequences for the company if the project did not succeed. “Had it not succeeded, not only would we have had the detriment of the lack of those products shipping, we wouldn’t have had something else to fill in at the same time,” Forstall explained.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs told the executives they could recruit anyone they wanted within the company to work on the project, but they absolutely could not go outside. “That was quite a challenge,” Forstall recalled. “The way I did it is I would find people who were true superstars at the company, just amazing engineers, and I would bring them to my office and I would sit them down and I would say, ‘You are a superstar in your <a id="pageMap_220"></a>current role. Your manager loves you. You’re going to be incredibly successful at Apple if you just stay in your current role and keep on doing what you want to do. I have another offer for you, another option. We’re starting a new project. It’s so secret, I can’t even tell you what that new project is’ . . . and amazingly, some tremendously talented people accepted that challenge and that’s how I put together the iPhone team.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber312"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber312" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Forstall commandeered an entire floor in one of the buildings at Apple HQ and had it locked down. “We put doors with badge readers, there were cameras, I think, to get to some of our labs, you had to badge in four times to get there,” he said. It was nicknamed the “Purple Dorm.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“People were there all the time,” Forstall said. “They were there at night. They were there on weekends. You know, it smelled something like pizza.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“On the front door of the purple dorm, we put a sign up that said ‘Fight Club’ because the first rule of <em class="calibre3">Fight Club</em> in the movie is you don’t talk about Fight Club, and the first rule about the purple project is you do not talk about that outside of those doors.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over in IDg, Jony began, as usual, with the iPhone’s story. As he later explained, it was all about how the user would <em class="calibre3">feel</em> about the device. “When we are at these early stages in design, when we’re trying to establish some of the primary goals—often we’ll talk about the story for the product—we’re talking about perception. We’re talking about how you feel about the product, not in a physical sense, but in a perceptual sense.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony believed the iPhone would be all about the screen. In their earliest discussions, the designers agreed that nothing should detract from the screen, which Jony likened to an “infinity pool,” those high-end swimming pools with an invisible edge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What that did was make it very clear in our minds that the display was important, and we wanted to develop a product that featured and <a id="pageMap_221"></a>deferred to the display,” he said. “Some of our early discussions about the iPhone centered on this idea of . . . this infinity pool, this pond, where the display would sort of magically appear.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber313"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber313" class="calibre2">11</a></sup> The team made a point in exploring design ideas to avoid any approaches that would diminish the importance of the display.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony said they wanted the display to be “magical” and “surprising.” These were his high-end goals for any eventual design. “In the earliest stages of this design, this seemed—this was very new, and it felt there was real opportunity to develop a design story based on those sorts of preoccupations,” he later explained.<a id="SuperscriptNumber314"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber314" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Late in the fall of 2004, Jony’s design team began work on two distinct design directions. One, called Extrudo, was led by Chris Stringer, and it resembled the iPod mini. It was made from a flattened tube of extruded aluminum and could be anodized in different colors. Apple already had big production lines making and anodizing iPod cases in huge numbers. That was one advantage of that direction, along with the fact that Jony and team loved what could be done with extrusion.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The other design, called Sandwich, was led by Richard Howarth. Made mostly of plastic, with a plastic screen, the Sandwich design was rectangular with evenly rounded corners. It had a metal band running around the midpoint of its body, a centered display on the front face, a menu button centered below the screen and a speaker slot centered above the screen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and his team preferred the Extrudo look and gave it the most attention. They tried cases that were extruded along the x-axis, and some along the y-axis. But problems surfaced immediately. Extrudo’s hard edges hurt the designers’ faces when they put it up to their ears. Jobs especially hated this.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To make the hard edges softer, plastic end caps were added, which also helped with the radio antennas. The iPhone would have three <a id="pageMap_222"></a>radios: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a cell radio. But radio waves won’t pass through a metal shell, so the plastic endcaps became essential.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The team struggled to solve Extrudo’s problems, but engineering tests made it clear this particular design direction wouldn’t work unless the plastic endcaps for the radios got bigger. But bigger caps would ruin the clean Extrudo look. “We made books and books filled with pages of designs trying to figure out how not to break up the design because of the antenna, how not to make the earpiece too hard and sharp, and so on,” said Satzger. “But it seemed like all the solutions that added comfort detracted from the overall design.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Extrudo design had another problem that nagged at Jobs: The metal bezel detracted from the screen. The design didn’t “defer” to the screen, which had been one of Jony’s original goals. Jony later recalled his flush of embarrassment when Jobs pointed it out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple killed Extrudo; the team was left with Sandwich.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Sandwich design did have several advantages over Extrudo, one of which was that the rounded edges didn’t hurt the designers’ ears. But the engineering prototypes came back big and chunky, and Jony’s team struggled to slim it down. They were trying to cram in a lot of technology, much of which hadn’t yet been miniaturized enough for a device as complex as the phone everyone envisioned.</p>
