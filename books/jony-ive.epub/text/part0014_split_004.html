<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_4">From Plastic to Glass</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">While Apple’s operations group was working out how to manufacture the iPhone, Jony’s design team was having doubts about their original choice of material for the screen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and his team planned to use plastic, mostly because it was shatterproof. Although all of the iPhone prototypes had plastic screens, the designers were never happy with it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The original plastic face had this weird flexibility to it,” said Satzger. “It was a matte finish. If it goes to glossy plastic, you see this waviness <a id="pageMap_227"></a>to it, which makes it look really crappy.” Jony instructed the team to try textured plastic, but that didn’t work either. In a gutsy next move, they decided to try glass, despite the facts that glass breaks easily and no one had made a consumer electronic device with such a big piece of glass.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The story of the shift to glass is variously remembered: Although Jony’s group was already investigating glass, Jobs is credited by some as initiating the move to glass. As the story goes, he’d been using an iPhone prototype, which he kept in his pocket with his keys. He was reportedly furious that they scratched the screen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I won’t sell a product that gets scratched,” Jobs said later. “I want a glass screen, and I want it perfect in six weeks.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber317"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber317" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A deeper version has it that the development took more like six months in advance of launch, not six weeks. Apple’s operations group was charged with finding the strongest glass available. The search led them to Corning Incorporated, a glass manufacturer headquartered in upstate New York.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 1960, Corning had created a nearly unbreakable reinforced glass they called “muscled glass” or Chemcor. The key to its manufacture was an innovative chemical process in which glass is dipped into a hot bath of potassium salt. Smaller sodium atoms leave the glass, and are replaced by bigger potassium atoms from the salt. When the glass cools, the bigger potassium atoms are packed in so tightly they give the glass exceptional damage resistance. The glass can withstand pressures of 100,000 pounds per square inch (normal glass handles about 7,000). Chemcor’s market future seemed bright, but it never took off. Other than its use in some airplanes and American Motors Javelin cars, the material sold poorly and Corning discontinued it in 1971.<a id="SuperscriptNumber318"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber318" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Apple’s operations group came calling in 2006, they found Corning had been thinking about bringing back the old superglass for a couple of years. They’d seen Motorola use glass for its RAZR V3 phone <a id="pageMap_228"></a>and begun to explore ways to make Chemcor thin enough to be suitable for cell phones.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s ID group came up with spec: The glass needed to be 1.3 mm to fit into the iPhone design. Jobs told Corning’s CEO, Wendell Weeks, they had six weeks to create as much of it as they could. Weeks replied they didn’t have the capacity and actually, Chemcor had never been created in this way or in such volume. “None of our plants make the glass now,” he told Jobs. But Jobs cajoled the CEO. “Get your mind around it,” he said. “You can do it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber319"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber319" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Almost overnight, the company completely remade its manufacturing processes, based in Kentucky, changing several of its LCD-making plants to muscled glass, by then renamed Gorilla Glass. In May 2007, Corning was making thousands of yards of Gorilla Glass.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Corning’s glass, in combination with the aluminum back, marked another change in Jony’s design language. It was a striking, almost shocking, minimalism in hard metal and glass.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To hold the glass screen in place, Jony’s team came up with a shiny stainless steel bezel, which doubled as a structural element. The bezel would give the iPhone strength, but it also needed to look good.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s team worried that the glass would smash if the phone was dropped. “We were putting glass in close proximity to hardened steel,” said Satzger, who pointed out that, “if you drop [the phone], you don’t have to worry about the ground hitting the glass. You have to worry about the band of steel surrounding the glass hitting the glass.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The solution was a thin rubber gasket between the glass screen and the stainless steel bezel. But the gasket created a gap that, at least at first, the designers hated for a very personal reason. “Because many of us in the ID team rarely shaved and had beard stubble, it used to yank our facial hair when we held the device up to our faces,” said Satzger, laughing at the memory. The team played around with gap size until they got it right. <a id="pageMap_229"></a>“We designed several increments of gap size between the metal and glass until we got one that didn’t yank our face hair.”</p>
