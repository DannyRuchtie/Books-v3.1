			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Less than a year after the iPad’s initial launch, in March 2011, Apple surprised the world by announcing a sequel. The new version would be not only a big upgrade in terms of the hardware capability but a wholesale design turnover.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPad 2 was thinner and lighter than the original. It gained key new features like front and back cameras, as well as thoughtful touches like a magnetic cover that turned the iPad off and on. The design marked a big advance in manufacturing (with the unibody process), which allowed Jony to fashion the deeply beveled back he originally wanted, but in metal, using Apple’s new unibody manufacturing process. “By reducing what were essentially three surfaces to two, we got rid of the structural wall around the perimeter of the product and eliminated the edge. It’s not only more comfortable to hold, but with the breakthrough we made through unibody engineering, it’s rigid, sturdy and even more precise.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber333"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber333" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once again, Jony was extremely proud of his group’s efforts. “I can’t think of a product that has defined an entire category and then has been completely redesigned in such a short period of time. It is really defined by the display. There are just no distractions.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber334"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber334" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_239"></a>In March 2012, Apple followed up with the third-generation iPad, which added a high-density retina display, a faster chip and better cameras. In October of the same year, the fourth-generation iPad was launched with a much faster processor and cell connection, as well as a tiny lightning connector to replace the original thirty-pin connector, which was long in the tooth and had become a legacy technology.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In their constant iterations, Apple was beating the “fast followers” at their own game. Fast followers take a winning product, make it cheaper and get it on the market very quickly. Sometimes the products are cheap knockoffs, but often they are good-enough rivals, as myriad Android phones contest. But by upgrading the iPad quickly and aggressively, and making it significantly better with each version, Apple was staying ahead of their competitors.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The fourth-generation iPad was joined by the iPad mini in 2012, which shrank the screen to just under eight inches, and was enthusiastically snapped up by users. “The Mini gives you all the iPad goodness in a more manageable size, and it’s awesome,” wrote David Pogue, an influential tech reviewer with the <em class="calibre3">New York Times</em>. “You could argue that the iPad Mini is what the iPad always wanted to be.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber335"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber335" class="calibre2">11</a></sup> In the first quarter of 2013, the iPad mini accounted for about 60 percent of all iPad sales.<a id="SuperscriptNumber336"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber336" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">From the initial launch and almost overnight, iPads appeared at cafés and on cross-country flights. Apple executives had predicted several times that the iPad would one day replace the PC, but that switch started happening quicker than anyone expected. In the first year, Apple sold nearly fifteen million iPads. By the fourth quarter of 2011, Apple sold more iPads in just three months than any of its rivals sold PCs. By 2015, tablets (most of them iPads) will have more market share than the entire traditional PC market, according to estimates by the market research firm Interactive Data Corporation. The post-PC era, led by Jony and Apple, is upon us.</p>
