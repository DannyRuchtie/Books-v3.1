<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_4">Frustrations</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Ideal Standard had been rebuffed when it asked to work directly with Jony at RWG, but Tangerine was only too happy to oblige the company. Early in Jony’s time at Tangerine, Ideal Standard commissioned a new line of bathroom appliances, including a toilet, bidet and sink, to replace the company’s long-running Michelangelo line.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With characteristic thoroughness, Jony, Grinyer and Darbyshire applied themselves to the new bathroom suite. But the work, which had seemed like a lifesaver for the young company, soon turned into a nightmare. Looking back on it, the episode probably planted the seeds of Jony’s eventual departure.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As he threw himself into the work for Ideal Standard, Jony bought marine biology books for inspiration and scoured them for influences from nature. “Jony was very fascinated with water, and he looked a lot at water flow,” recalled Grinyer. “He took his inspiration for the bowl he designed as almost a Greek religious artifact.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He talked about the worshipping of water. That water was going to become a scarce resource. That water was something that must be honored. So he made an elliptical bowl, with an incredible architectural pillar. It was beautifully radical.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber81"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber81" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony, Grinyer and Darbyshire presented Ideal Standard with three collections, each named after Ninja Turtles that, in turn, had gotten their names from the Renaissance artists Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo.<a id="SuperscriptNumber82"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber82" class="calibre2">26</a></sup> They went to Jony’s parents’ garage—the senior Ives by then had moved to rural Somerset—and produced handmade foam models of sinks and toilets. They were “stunningly good,” said Grinyer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_49"></a>The three designers drove to Ideal Standard’s headquarters in Hull to pitch the company on the new designs. They set up in a large room so that a product manager could eyeball the models to see if they were fit for presentation. When they were ushered into a meeting with the CEO and a couple of other executives, however, they failed to impress.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The CEO rejected the designs outright in a torrent of criticism. They were too expensive to produce, he said, and they didn’t fit into the established design line. The executive worried that the sink’s architectural pillar, which Jony had been very proud of, might fall over and crush children.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The presentation was hard work,” remembered Grinyer. “Our ideas for the designs fell flat. . . . The problem was that our designs were very different to Ideal Standard’s usual range of products.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To make matters worse, the CEO was wearing a red clown’s nose made of foam. It was the UK’s Comic Relief Day, a nationwide fund-raiser where everyone wears red clown noses to raise money for charity. The rejection seemed like a bad joke indeed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer said Jony drove back to London dispirited. “He was dejected and depressed,” recalled Grinyer. “He had poured himself into working for people who really didn’t care.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber83"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber83" class="calibre2">27</a></sup> Darbyshire remembered that day too. “Jony was unhappy that they hadn’t completely loved his designs.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s good humor usually allowed him to laugh off such setbacks, but the crashing failure at Ideal Standard wasn’t so easy to forget. Even though the dejected Jony would continue the development of the design, the process felt wrong to him. According to Darbyshire, “The problem was that they wanted to ‘productionize it’ and, in so doing, tore out its heart and soul.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Despite the initial failure with Ideal Standard, Tangerine was beginning to work with more and more big clients. The team, according to Grinyer, <a id="pageMap_50"></a>felt as if they were on a “rollercoaster.” They continued to cleverly publicize themselves. “We did a lot of speculative pieces whereby I came up with some concepts and Jony did amazing design works, which we could then push out to the press, get them beautifully photographed and create a buzz,” said Grinyer. “Within just five years, we went from a small company operating out of a back room of a house in London to having big international customers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony didn’t enjoy the fact that part of his job involved selling the firm. “At Tangerine, it was always very important that the four partners were the creatives,” Grinyer explained. “We were perhaps proud of ourselves and we wanted to carry on designing rather than be figureheads who took on commissions and passed them on to behind-the-scenes employees to do the work. However, despite this, as an agency we were spending up to ninety percent of our time selling our services. Jony was younger than we were, and wanted to devote all his time to designing great stuff. He could sometimes feel frustrated.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony gradually realized that he wasn’t cut out for consulting. He loved to design, but found the concessions necessary to build the business difficult, resisting the reality that, in small partnerships, every designer should also be a salesperson.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I was pretty naïve,” Jony said later. “I hadn’t been out of college for long but I learnt lots by designing a range of different objects: from hair combs and ceramics, to power tools and televisions. Importantly, I worked out what I was good at and what I was bad at. It became pretty clear what I wanted to do. I was really only interested in design. I was neither interested, nor good at, building a business.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber84"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber84" class="calibre2">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It particularly upset him when his work got ruined by the people he was working for. His old boss at RWG, Phil Gray, spoke to Jony in 2012: “Jony told me that the reason he was so frustrated in consultancy was because he was not able to see projects through to completion,” reported Gray. “Clients <a id="pageMap_51"></a>would select bits of what he had produced and then instruct him how to put together those bits according to their own ideas. He was not able to execute what he had in mind for any project. He was so far ahead of his time, that clients often just did not get what he was doing.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber85"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber85" class="calibre2">29</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer had also seen Jony’s frustration with the clients. “Frequently he would make a beautiful design, which when engineered would look only half as good as it should have done.”</p>
