			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Apple’s factory in Singapore produced the iMac’s motherboard, but the other components, including the revolutionary case, were made and assembled by LG in the specially set-up factory in South Korea.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and Danny Coster visited the factory several times with engineers from the product design group to fine-tune the case molds. Visiting the factory is standard design practice, but Jony’s team went above and beyond, spending far more time at the plant than is usual in order to get the iMac perfect. Most of the workers lived in dorms and ate in a big, on-site cafeteria. Jony and Danny often ate in the cafeteria, too, but stayed in a nearby hole-in-the-wall hotel. On their last visit before the iMac was released, they stayed for two weeks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We were in the factory most of the time, from 8 a.m. in the morning until 8 to 9 p.m. or even 1 or 2 a.m.,” said Amir Homayounfar, a manager on the product design team. “They would basically bring samples throughout and the CAD guys and the tooling engineers would make further modifications and then we’d be back for more.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber196"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber196" class="calibre2">46</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At first, the cases came out of the molds with lots of burrs and sharp edges. “To make it basically as perfect as possible,” Homayounfar said, “we would go through that iteration multiple times until Jony and Danny were satisfied with the samples. Perfection was the goal.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As launch day approached, Jony and Danny returned to the factory with twenty-eight engineers to prepare a batch of samples. The team worked long into the night, all weekend, getting the machines ready. “We were all there scrubbing these plastic cases with sandpaper to get thirty units to ship back to the U.S. for the launch of the iMac,” said Homayounfar. “Thirty Apple guys plus the entire LG factory.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony needed thirty Apple employees at the factory because each person would check an iMac as luggage on the plane. “We flew direct <a id="pageMap_131"></a>from Seoul to San Francisco and an Apple truck came by at the airport and took them away. So they went from the factory to the airport, to Cupertino and to the Apple campus,” said Homayounfar. “They fired them up and got Steve to come and look at them. He cherry-picked the best ones and we were ready for the launch announcement.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were still bumps in the road ahead, however. The day before the launch, while practicing his presentation with a hastily assembled prototype, Jobs pressed a button on the front of the tray. The tray slid out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What the fuck is this?” he asked. He had been expecting a slot-loading drive, which were just starting to appear on high-end stereos.<a id="SuperscriptNumber197"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber197" class="calibre2">47</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No one said a thing, but Jobs flew into a full-on rage. Rubinstein had chosen a tray drive to keep pace with rapidly changing CD technology. With writeable CD drives on the horizon, Rubinstein knew a slot-loading drive would put the iMac a generation behind. He insisted that Jobs had been aware of this, but Jobs became so upset, he nearly canceled the launch.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was my first product launch with Steve and the first time I saw his mind-set of ‘If it’s not right we’re not launching it,’” remembered Schiller. Jobs was mollified only when Rubinstein promised to replace the CD drive in the next release.<a id="SuperscriptNumber198"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber198" class="calibre2">48</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On May 6, 1998—the following day—Jobs unveiled the iMac at a packed Flint Center in Cupertino. It was the same venue where Apple introduced the original Macintosh fourteen years earlier.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The event drew a big crowd of technology press. The auditorium was buzzing with excitement as a giant inflatable beach ball bounced around and people took their seats. “I haven’t seen this much energy around Apple since 1989,” said Bajarin, the analyst who had been at Jobs’s design meeting several months before.<a id="SuperscriptNumber199"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber199" class="calibre2">49</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs kicked off the show by showing a new TV ad poking fun at Intel. <a id="pageMap_132"></a>On screen, a steamroller flattened several Pentium notebooks as the theme from the old <em class="calibre3">Peter Gunn</em> TV show blasted. The audience howled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs detailed the shortcomings of PCs for consumers: They were slow, complex and unattractive. “This is what they look like today,” Jobs said, as a beige computer was projected onto the backdrop behind him. “And I’d like to take the privilege of showing you what they are going to look like from today on.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber200"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber200" class="calibre2">50</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He strolled over to a pedestal in the middle of the stage and pulled a black cloth off an iMac, which gleamed and sparkled under the auditorium spotlights. Jobs looked like he’d been expecting applause, but the audience, previously excited, reacted in stunned silence.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The whole thing is translucent,” Jobs gushed. “You can see into it. It’s soooo cool! . . . The back of this thing looks better than the front of the other guy’s.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As a cameraman walked around the iMac onstage, showing it from all angles, the audience started to respond. “It looks like it’s from another planet,” Jobs said proudly, eliciting a laugh from the crowd. “A good planet. A planet with better designers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and most of the design team were sitting in the audience. “I was very proud of the iMac on its release, because I had had the chance to have a lot of influence on it and had done a lot of work on many of the parts,” Satzger said. “I was sitting among a crowd of Apple employees when Jobs pulled off the sheet to reveal the iMac, and all these Apple people were exhibiting surprise. I realized that none of them had seen it yet. They were working on legal, sales, operations, even software people, and none of them had been shown the machine, had been allowed to see it. That was a shock to me.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber201"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber201" class="calibre2">51</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iMac began shipping on August 15, 1998. Jobs had bet the future of Apple on the machine, and, during the summer leading up to its release, Apple spent one hundred million dollars on advertising. To <a id="pageMap_133"></a>prime the pump with the press, Apple’s PR department told reporters to expect the biggest launch in Apple history.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple’s comprehensive advertising campaign blanketed TV, print and billboards with colorful, witty ads. The campaign emphasized the iMac’s funky design and ease of use. One amusing TV ad depicted a race to set up a new iMac for surfing the Web versus a PC. The spot pitted a seven-year-old and his dog against a Stanford PhD student. (No prizes for guessing who won.) Another advertising theme, entitled the “Un-PC,” contrasted the nest of cords associated with most computers with the iMac’s clean, uncluttered design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A week before its release, Apple announced 150,000 preorders for the iMac, and Apple’s stock soared to more than forty dollars a share, its highest in three years. The company arranged special launch events at big-box computer stores (the first Apple stores were several years in the future), which were attended by some of the company’s executives, including Jony.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite the hype, the first reviews were surprisingly negative, sometimes brutally so. The iMac was too radical a break with the past, they said. Tech reviewers, who, counterintuitively, tend to be rather a conservative bunch, complimented the funky design, but complained about the legacy-free technology. There was an uproar in the tech press about the lack of a floppy drive. Most articles obsessed about it. Many said the machine was stillborn without it. “The iMac will only sell to some of the true believers,” wrote Hiawatha Bray in the <em class="calibre3">Boston Globe</em>. “The iMac doesn’t include a floppy disk drive for doing file backups or sharing of data. It’s an astonishing lapse from Jobs, who should have learned better . . . the iMac is clean, elegant, floppy-free—and doomed.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber202"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber202" class="calibre2">52</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The lack of a floppy put Jony on the defensive. “I can’t give you the best Apple answer on the lack of the floppy,” he said. “I can give you my answer: ‘When you move on, you leave some things behind. The floppy drive, <a id="pageMap_134"></a>which I will argue until I’m blue in the face, is really antiquated technology. I’ve heard the complaints, but if there’s not some sort of friction in a move forward, your step is not as consequential as you’d like to believe it is.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber203"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber203" class="calibre2">53</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Other familiar complaints about the Mac also surfaced, including the relatively high price, the incompatibility with Windows and the paucity of software compared to Microsoft’s dominant platform. “Doubts about software availability make it difficult for customers to pony up the money for a Mac when a Windows-based machine is often cheaper,” the Associated Press said. “And with about three percent of the computer market, the Mac is simply seen as a fringe product by many shoppers.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber204"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber204" class="calibre2">54</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nonetheless, Apple’s fan base was pumped. “It’s just wildly different,” Hal Gibson, executive director of the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group, said. “And when Apple does that, something daring, that’s very exciting.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber205"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber205" class="calibre2">55</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Many retailers were also enthusiastic. “We’ll sell lots of them. This is the sexiest computer I’ve ever seen,” said Jim Halpin, president and CEO of CompUSA, at the time the biggest computer retailer in the United States.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The reaction from consumers was unmistakable. The iMac went on sale in August 1998 for $1,299. It sold 278,000 units in its first six weeks, and would sell 800,000 by the end of the year, making it the fastest-selling computer in Apple history. Just as Jobs had hoped and predicted, the iMac sold well to first-time computer buyers and unhappy PC users, with an impressive 32 percent of the sales going to first-timers and another 12 percent to “switchers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Reporter Jon Fortt, writing in the <em class="calibre3">San Jose Mercury News</em>, noted that Apple’s focus on the needs of the consumer made the iMac a hit. “What made the original iMac cool was not its color or shape. It was Apple’s demonstrated willingness to open the possibilities of Internet computing to an audience that had been ignored by the brainiacs who design PCs.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber206"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber206" class="calibre2">56</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of the quarter, Apple announced its third consecutive <a id="pageMap_135"></a>profit since Jobs’s return; the $101 million exceeded everybody’s expectations and prompted a raft of Apple-is-back stories.</p>
