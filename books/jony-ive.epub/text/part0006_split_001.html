<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="pageMap_20" class="calibre2"></a>“He Looked Like a Hairbrush!”</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">In his second year at Newcastle, Jony undertook the first of two semester-long placements with his sponsor, the Roberts Weaver Group in London.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At RWG, Jony met Clive Grinyer, a senior designer. Grinyer, who would become a lifelong friend and have a big influence on Ive’s life, has himself had a long and fruitful career, even rising to director of design and innovation at Britain’s Design Council.<a id="SuperscriptNumber35"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber35" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer and Jony immediately hit it off, despite the age difference (Jony was eight years younger)—and Jony’s weird haircut. He had a shoulder-length mullet with a fringe that was back-combed to stick straight up. “He had a little round face and mad hair sprouting out,” Grinyer said. “He looked like a hairbrush!”<a id="SuperscriptNumber36"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber36" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer saw beyond the hair and noticed that Jony immersed himself in all the ongoing projects, despite being the office’s most junior intern. “The amusing thing is, looking back, that even though there were eight to ten quite experienced designers there, all the work in the studio was going to this student! So Jony was already famous by the time I joined RWG.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber37"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber37" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and Grinyer shared a similar sense of humor, and Grinyer liked the young man’s quiet confidence, even though Ive initially came across as shy and self-deprecating. “He and I immediately became good friends,” said Grinyer. “He was ego-free, which was very rare in the design student world. Most design students had lots of ego and very little talent. Jony was the other way round. When designing, he was clearly in love with what he was doing. He became so fixated on all his tasks.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer had recently spent a year in San Francisco working at ID Two, the U.S. offshoot of Moggridge Associates, a firm founded by Bill Moggridge, the legendary designer who died in 2011. Another well-spoken and articulate Englishman, Moggridge is credited with designing <a id="pageMap_21"></a>the first laptop, the GRiD Compass, a now-iconic clamshell design of screen and hinged keyboard.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was fascinated by Grinyer’s experiences in the States, and peppered Grinyer with questions about America. “Jony was really interested in California,” Grinyer recalled. “He was fascinated by the opportunities and the way of life there. Designers are always very aware of the culture of each client for whom they undertake projects, because designers are either enabled or inhibited by the client’s attitudes to manufacturing processes such as tooling and so on. And America represented a lot of possibilities for Jony. In the 1980s, the San Francisco Bay Area was a very attractive destination for European designers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s imaginative designs led to his rapid rise as the company’s golden boy and he was placed on an account for the Japanese market. In the eighties, Japan had been like China today, an emerging economic powerhouse. According to RWG designer Peter Phillips, the firm, then one of the top design firms in London, got into Japan by paying a Japanese marketing company to promote its work. The freelance company was expensive, as it took 40 percent of the firm’s fees, but worth the price. RWG soon received commissions for all types of Japanese work.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was instructed to work on a range of leather goods and wallets for Japan’s Zebra Co. Ltd., a pen manufacturer based in Tokyo. Typical of his style, Jony made intricate prototype wallets out of paper. “I remember him folding and playing with these beautiful all-white folded-out wallets, all double-sided with the leaves,” Peter Phillips recalled. “In the corner he’d cut out the tiny detail that showed the embossing. It was an absolute beauty. The most incredible model I’d ever seen. It was stunning.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber38"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber38" class="calibre2">18</a></sup> The wallets were one of Jony’s first products in white, a sign of the designer’s lifelong commitment to the color.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Phillips laughed that Jony, a teenager, was working on the boss’s “pet <a id="pageMap_22"></a>projects” while he and the other salaried designers slaved away on what he called “the dirty ones.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was soon tasked with a new pet project: to create a line of pens for Zebra. After making countless drawings, Jony came up with an elegant design with a special touch that would earn him an immediate reputation in London design circles. Phil Gray, the RWG design director who had agreed to help pay Jony’s way through college, remembered the drawings Jony made for the project.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He created some wonderful rendering techniques that were totally original,” said Gray. “He did some beautiful drawings on film whereby he coated the back of the film with gouache [paint] and then turned the film over and did some very fine line work on the other face, so that there was a translucent effect on the drawing. This effect was absolutely brilliant at conveying the materials he was imagining. When he sketched, he was such a fine draftsman that you could not tell whether he had drawn in freehand or used a radius guide. He was that meticulous.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber39"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber39" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s pen was to be made of white plastic with rubbery side rivets, like small teeth, for a better grip. Again, the product was white, but what set the pen apart from every other was a nonessential feature.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In working out his design, Jony chose to focus on the pen’s “fiddle factor.” He observed that people fiddled with their pens all the time, and decided to give the pens’ owners something to play with when not writing. He cleverly added a ball-and-clip mechanism to the top of the pen that served no purpose other than to give the owner something to fiddle with. The “fiddle-factor” notion may have seemed trivial to some, but the incorporation of the ball and clip transformed the pen into something special.<a id="SuperscriptNumber40"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber40" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That was a new idea back then, to put something on a pen that was purely there to fiddle with,” Grinyer said. “He was really thinking <a id="pageMap_23"></a>differently. The pen’s design was not just about shape, but also there was an emotional side to it. This, believe it or not, was quite jaw-dropping, especially from someone so young.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony made a prototype that so delighted his boss, Barrie Weaver, that he ended up playing with it all the time. Other designers at RWG noticed, and people started saying the object had a “Jony-ness” about it, a term that suggested an object possessed a sort of unknowable property that made people want to touch it and play with it.<a id="SuperscriptNumber41"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber41" class="calibre2">21</a></sup> Ive’s talent for adding tactile elements to his designs was already emerging as one of the young man’s trademarks (many of his subsequent designs at Apple had handles or other elements that encouraged touching). His unusual pen anticipated the kind of allegiance that later Jony-designed products would inspire. The pen “immediately became the owner’s prize possession, something you always wanted to play with,” Grinyer recalled.<a id="SuperscriptNumber42"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber42" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s TX2 pen went into production, something almost unheard-of for an intern’s design. It sold in large numbers in Japan for many years and, in the memory of his RWG colleagues, was typical of the young designer’s work. According to Grinyer, “His designs were incredibly simple and elegant. They were usually rather surprising but made complete sense once you saw them. You wondered why we had never seen a product like that before.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber43"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber43" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
