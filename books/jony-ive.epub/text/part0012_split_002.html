			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">For reasons that no one seems to remember, P-68 came to be known among insiders as “Project Dulcimer.” Jobs had green-lighted it, but one main player on the project, Tony Fadell, not only didn’t work at Apple, he didn’t particularly want to. Fadell pitched Rubinstein on awarding the job to his start-up on a contract basis, but Rubinstein refused. Instead, he extended the reluctant Fadell’s contract.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the project moved forward, however, Rubinstein got more and more uncomfortable with the arrangement: He wanted Fadell on board full time at Apple. Four weeks after the initial meeting with Jobs, Fadell was slated to present the iPod to a team of twenty-five Apple bigwigs, including Jony (who, at that stage, knew nothing of the new player’s progress). With Fadell busy streamlining his ideas, Rubinstein devised an ultimatum to get him to sign on with Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before the meeting—with Jony and the others waiting—Rubinstein gave Fadell a choice. If Fadell wasn’t going to take the job, Rubinstein threatened to call off the meeting. If Fadell didn’t sign on to Apple on their terms, it would be the end of the project and the end of the iPod.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_178"></a>Fadell took the meeting and the job.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once on staff, Fadell assumed charge of the project’s engineering. Robbin headed up the software and interface team, while Rubinstein oversaw everything. The collective responsibility was obvious enough: create a product to satisfy Jobs’s desire for an MP3 player worthy of the Apple marque and to do it by the looming deadline. The team’s newest member, Jony Ive, would be responsible for the look, workmanship and usability of the finished product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To meet the tight production deadline, Fadell matched up the drive from Toshiba with a cell phone battery and screen from Sony; a stereo digital-to-analog converter from a small Scottish company, Wolfson Microelectronics; a FireWire interface controller from Texas Instruments; a flash memory chip from Sharp Electronics; a power management/battery charging chip from Linear Technologies Inc.; and an MP3 decoder and controller chip from PortalPlayer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fadell took a trip to Asia to meet with suppliers. He didn’t tell them exactly what they might be building, but presented some vague specs for the work Apple wanted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The earliest prototypes were built in reinforced Perspex boxes about the size of shoe boxes, which made them easy to debug. The big shoe boxes also helped disguise the fact they were working on a music player, because the team couldn’t tell anyone what they were working on, even inside the company. To further obscure what they were doing, the teams put the buttons and screen in different places each time a new prototype was made. One engineer noted that it was all a silly subterfuge; a single look inside revealed immediately it was a small pocket device.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s role, as he recalled later, was to help fulfill the design brief they’d been handed for Project Dulcimer. It was, in short, to create something “very, very new.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber253"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber253" class="calibre2">3</a></sup></p>
