			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The design team next turned their attention to the third quadrant of Steve’s 2×2 product plan to be filled: a portable for consumers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The brief was simple,” said one of the designers. “Bring the iMac to laptops.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The initial ideas for the iBook were all over the map. They came from brainstorming sessions, not from focus groups or market surveys. “We <a id="pageMap_146"></a>don’t do focus groups—that is the job of the designer,” said Jony. “It’s unfair to ask people who don’t have a sense of the opportunities of tomorrow from the context of today to design.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber225"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber225" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the time, laptops tended to be boxy, black and starkly utilitarian. “We were given a lot of freedom,” Satzger said, though everyone understood the new machine would echo the iMac’s curves and colorful, translucent plastic body. What emerged looked nothing like its competitors, not only in its use of curvaceous lines but because it screamed color and fun. Jony initially drew its curvy “clamshell” design that resembled an undersea creature, then handed it off to Chris Stringer to be the design lead.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The designers also incorporated a clever innovation, novel for computers at the time: The iBook “awakened” as the lid was lifted. This feature required the design team to labor on a latchless mechanism to keep the lid tightly closed when the iBook wasn’t in use, because the last thing they wanted was for the computer to wake up in someone’s knapsack and drain the batteries.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The shell also had an integrated carrying handle, which made the device look like a colorful plastic purse. A handle on a laptop made sense, just as it had on the Macintosh SketchPad that Jony helped design for Bob Brunner’s Juggernaut project. But again, it served a dual purpose: adding portability while encouraging a connection with the machine, making it less intimidating.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The iBook has been designed to encourage users to touch it,” Jony explained. “The use of curved surfaces and rubberized materials give it an intimate, tactile feel.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber226"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber226" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The manufacturing of the iBook—case, handle and lid—all introduced serious challenges. To start, the iBook’s case was made from a hard polycarbonate plastic bonded to thermoplastic polyurethane, the latter a rubbery compound that softened the case’s edges and made it <a id="pageMap_147"></a>resistant to bumps. The polycarbonate case was also bonded to the guts inside. “It was a question of shape and layering—layering plastics and sheet metal below,” said Satzger. “But the product was massive. There were lots of manufacturing challenges. We spent a lot of time in Taiwan working on layering materials. There was a ton of problems.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The complex clamshell shape created a huge molding headache. To make the shell and get it out of the mold afterward, the mold had to pull apart in multiple directions and, initially, the case was plagued with micro-cracks that formed as the plastic cooled. Nor was the carrying handle easy to manufacture. It was made from a special plastic from DuPont called Surlyn, molded over a magnesium core to give it strength. Surlyn is a tough, impact-resistant plastic used in golf balls, but to make a handle of it required a molding technique called metal injection molding. First, the metal part was inserted into the molding tool; then the colored Surlyn plastic was molded around it. But metal and plastic have different cooling rates, so the part would shatter as soon as the mold was opened. The team spent weeks at the factories in Asia tweaking the molds and chemical mixes of the different plastics, but eventually overcame all of the problems.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The game-changing latchless lid also proved to be an issue—ultimately solvable—which Jony’s team labored for months to figure out. They came up with the solution of making a special hinge that held the lid tightly shut when closed. Getting rid of the latch was not initially seen as a “wow” factor but part of the team’s relentless drive to make products with fewer and fewer parts—again, a defining characteristic of Jony’s design vision. “Less parts means better tolerancing and better part-to-part relationships,” said one designer. In other words, the product goes together better.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These features—the rubbery skin, the carrying handle and hinge—and the consequent complexities delayed the iBook for months, but <a id="pageMap_148"></a>advance word on the iBook was strong. The new machine was much sought after, and electronics stores started taking preorders in advance of its debut.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the iBook did launch, one wag said it looked like “Barbie’s toilet seat,” a name that stuck.<a id="SuperscriptNumber227"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber227" class="calibre2">14</a></sup> But the iBook was quickly a big hit with consumers, students and educators alike. More than a quarter million units shipped in the first three months after its release. Over the next few years, different enhancements of the clamshell iBook were issued, adding more color choices, extra memory and FireWire ports.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iBook would also gain a place in history for popularizing Wi-Fi, the now ubiquitous wireless networking technology. Apple didn’t invent Wi-Fi, but it was the first computer maker to recognize its potential, like it did with USB ports on the iMac. While Wi-Fi was available for other laptops, it required an add-on card with an ugly antenna sticking out the side. The iBook neatly solved this problem by providing built-in Wi-Fi.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While the iBook was in development, Apple started looking at home networking. The Internet was rapidly gaining users, and it was obvious that consumers would need networking technology at home. Apple’s competitors were looking to offer answers too: Compaq was pushing networking through home power outlets and Intel was considering phone jacks. “We looked at it and thought, ‘These are really stupid ideas,’” said Phil Schiller. Schools were a critical Apple market, and neither power-line networking nor individual phone lines would work there, so the company took another approach.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple had engineers involved with standards bodies (the committees that standardize technologies, like Bluetooth or USB, across the industry), and one of them alerted the executives to a new wireless networking technology called 802.11. As Schiller remembered, “We decided, really fast track . . . to change the physical design of all of our <a id="pageMap_149"></a>products to include antennas and card slots and to make a complete holistic solution to make 802.11 come out.” They decided to call their system of networking cards and base stations “Airport.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber228"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber228" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The clamshell model of the iBook was discontinued in 2001, replaced by a reinvented version of the notebook in white polycarbonate. But the iBook changed the game. Many of its innovations live on in products today, including the placement of the interface ports on the sides instead of the back; the latchless lid; and, of course, Wi-Fi, now standard on every laptop, tablet and smartphone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">With the success of the iMac and iBook, power at Apple inevitably shifted toward Jony’s industrial design group. Rubinstein was forced to bring in a stream of new engineers who were able—and willing—to execute the designs issuing from Jony’s group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There was a lot of turnover,” said a former hardware executive. “We more or less replaced the entire mechanical engineering group. A lot of old-timers quit. They couldn’t take the pace. We reduced product development from three years to nine months, made it one of the fastest companies in tech.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rubinstein elaborated: “We brought in new people to run mechanical engineering—the product design group, PD—so that ID would have partners who could execute the designs that they were coming up with. And likewise we also brought in Asian suppliers who could execute the designs, since it is equally essential to have the requisite manufacturing capability.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber229"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber229" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the old Apple, the engineers called the shots. In the new Apple, the product design team, which was responsible for making sure designs can actually be manufactured, deferred to the design group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“ID has the final say on everything,” said Amir Homayounfar, who <a id="pageMap_150"></a>worked at Apple for ten years, ending his career as a program manager in the product design group. “We were working for them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Marjorie Andresen went further. According to her, Jony’s group was becoming the most powerful voice in the company.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The biggest thing you had to understand about working with ID was that it was never an option to tell them no,” she said. “Even if what they wanted to do seemed expensive, ridiculous or even impossible you had to make it happen. . . . Whatever it took to get the job done.”</p>
