			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title">Design of the iPod</h1>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">Apple has created an art object for hardware and software to live in.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—BONO</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">In the early 2000s, Apple had stabilized. The Mac was a hit, and Apple had just introduced Mac OS X, a new operating system. OS X applications were in the works for editing video, storing photos and burning DVDs (iMovie, iPhoto and iDVD). What was missing was an application for digital music.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thanks to Napster, music was rapidly turning digital and CD burners were taking off. Apple would be almost the last computer maker to add CD burners to its computers. In an attempt to catch up, the company bought a third-party MP3 jukebox program for the Mac, SoundJam MP, from a small company, Casady &amp; Greene. Apple also hired Casady &amp; Greene’s hotshot programmer, Jeff Robbin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Robbin’s team relocated to Apple’s HQ and set about retooling SoundJam, stripping out a lot of features to make it accessible to first-time users. Under the direction of Jobs, Robbin spent several months simplifying the program, which Jobs introduced as iTunes at the Macworld Expo in January 2001.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While Robbin was working on iTunes, Jobs and the executives played with ideas for gadgets that could be used in conjunction with the software Apple was developing, including digital cameras and camcorders. An MP3 player seemed a particularly obvious target, partly because the early devices they saw on the market functioned poorly. In <a id="pageMap_173"></a>the words of Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of hardware marketing: “The products stank.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They were two kinds of MP3 players in the market at the time. One variety was big, ugly and bricklike, based on a traditional three-inch desktop hard drive; the other, which used expensive flash memory, stored only a few songs. Neither of them worked well with iTunes, but Jobs wondered if there was an opportunity to take advantage of the intelligence built into iTunes. He asked Rubinstein to look into it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Meanwhile, Jony’s group was already making prototypes of MP3 players. The prototypes were purely experimental, nothing more than concepts for potential products, like Brunner’s Juggernaut project had been. Inspired by the iMac’s see-through plastic design language, the players were based on small flash memory chips, capable of storing about an album’s worth of songs. “These smaller peripheral devices were considered more like extensions of a core ecosystem,” said one former designer. “Engineering was not involved, at least not in these early stages of concept presentations.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony particularly liked an MP3 player that resembled the iMac’s hockey-puck mouse, dressed out in transparent red plastic. Inspired by a yo-yo, the device had a groove around its perimeter for holding the earbud’s wires, which slotted into cutouts on the back. (It looked like a round version of the earbud packaging used with the iPhone 5.) The player was controlled by a series of buttons arranged in a circle, with a small black-and-white screen in the middle. It resembled what, eventually, would be the familiar iPod scroll wheel, but at that time was purely button based with no wheel to turn. Jony’s team made other versions, including some for watching video, but none of the prototypes were very compelling.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of February 2001, Jobs and Rubinstein were in Japan for Macworld Tokyo. Rubinstein took a routine meeting with Toshiba Corporation, one of Apple’s major component suppliers. At the end of <a id="pageMap_174"></a>their discussion, his hosts showed him a new hard drive, only 1.8 inches in diameter. Though tiny, it had five gigabytes of data storage—enough to hold an astounding one thousand CDs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Toshiba engineers didn’t know what to do with the hard drive and asked Rubinstein if they should put it in a camera. Rubinstein smiled but kept his thoughts to himself. He went straight back to the hotel and told Jobs he knew how to build Apple’s MP3 player. All he needed was a ten-million-dollar check.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs told him to go for it, but with a catch: He wanted the new device delivered by Christmas that year, meaning Rubinstein had to have the product ready by August in order to make the marketing cycle for the crucial holiday shopping season. Ruby had six months to come up with Apple’s first MP3 player.</p>
