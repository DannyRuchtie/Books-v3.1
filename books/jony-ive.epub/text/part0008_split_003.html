			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Although he wasn’t hired as a manager, Jony stood out as a natural leader. “Jony Ive was very serious about his work,” English remembered of those early days. “He had a ferocious intensity about it. He was calm, but very deep. He was very serious, but also a really nice guy. He led in a quiet way: he inspired people to work for him.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber133"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber133" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony began to emerge as Brunner’s second in command. Not only did he provide ideas and design taste, he soon helped recruit the next group of designers. Within a couple of years, Jony hired most of the rest of the team that would go on to make the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone, including Christopher Stringer, Richard Howarth, Duncan Robert Kerr and Doug Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Christopher Stringer, born in Australia in 1965, had been raised in the North of England. He attended North Staffordshire Polytechnic in Stoke-on-Trent and graduated from London’s Royal College of Art in 1986. A veteran of IDEO—hired in 1992, he helped develop Dell’s design language and won an ID Design Review Award for an innovative light switch—he was recruited by Jony in 1995 as a senior industrial designer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Stringer worked on the early PowerBooks and tower computers. Over the next seventeen years, he would be involved in all the major releases <a id="pageMap_81"></a>(including the iPhone), peripherals and in even smaller projects, like the design of product packaging. He was also the first designer to give testimony at the <em class="calibre3">Apple v. Samsung</em> trial, where, according to Reuters news service, “Stringer looked every inch the designer with his shoulder-length hair, salt-and-pepper beard, wearing an off-white suit with a narrow black tie.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber134"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber134" class="calibre2">24</a></sup> Stringer was often seen at Apple launch events talking side by side with Jony. The impression that they are close friends is enhanced by their shared history; both hail from Staffordshire and studied in the north of England.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Richard Paul Howarth was born in Lukasa, Zambia, and graduated from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London in 1993. He was recruited by Apple in 1996 from IDEO and became one of the group’s main designers. Howarth was the lead designer of the original iPhone, and a major contributor to the iPod touch and iPad.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another designer from the United Kingdom, Duncan Kerr graduated from the Imperial College London in 1985 with a degree in mechanical engineering and a degree in ID engineering from the Royal College of Art. He was also recruited from IDEO. As one of the team’s more technical members, Kerr has great influence in the development and investigations of new products and technologies. He helped pioneer the multi-touch technology that led to the iPhone and iPad. He has been named in numerous patents, including various technical innovations involving components like proximity detectors, display modules and magnetic connectors.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Doug Satzger was the fourth IDEO alumnus. Satzger attended the University of Cincinnati and graduated in 1985. He started his career at IDEO as an industrial design lead, before moving to design TVs at Thomson Consumer Electronics. He would work at Apple between 1996 and 2008 in the IDg. An Ohio native, his interest in materials and knowledge of manufacturing processes made him the group’s design <a id="pageMap_82"></a>lead for color, materials and finishes, working on the first iMac to the latest iPhone, iPods, iPad and MacBooks. Satzger has been named in many patents, mostly in electronic devices, displays, cursor controls, packaging and connectors. (After Apple, Satzger joined HP/Palm as the senior director of ID then moved to Intel, where he’s vice president of the Mobile and Communications Group and general manager of ID.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When the design team looked to recruit a new designer, engineering and computer skills were a plus, but not absolutely necessary. “We are looking for personality, overwhelming talent and the ability to work in a small group,” said De Iuliis. “We also want to be impressed with a designer to the point of intimidation.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber135"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber135" class="calibre2">25</a></sup> To put it another way, the group was more likely to hire a talented car designer than a mediocre computer guy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another key member of the group in the mid-1990s and after was Calvin Seid, a native of Portland, Oregon, who graduated from San Jose State University in 1983 and worked for design firms in Oregon and Silicon Valley after graduation. He joined the Apple IDg in 1993 to design and manage CPU projects. (He died unexpectedly on April 6, 2007, of coronary artery disease at the age of forty-six. He was popular, and his death upset the team greatly.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Though distinctly international, the design team profile was largely white and male. With the exception of Seid, who was of Filipino descent, the members of the team were all young white guys, most of them from the United Kingdom. There was one woman in the 1990s; by 2012, there were two women on the team of about sixteen designers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony’s had that core of people around since then. They’ve been commuting up and down Highway 280 together for twenty years now, between San Francisco and Cupertino,” said Sally Grisedale, who worked closely with Jony’s group in the late 1990s. “They’re tight. They’re family. Many started as single men and then they had families and now all live in the same neighborhood.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_83"></a>The IDg was a great place to work; it seemed like nobody ever quit. But the lack of turnover was actually a challenge. Jony would admit to complicated feelings about the stability of the team. “Though we don’t want people to leave the group, the lack of movement makes it difficult to bring in fresh talent,” he said. “We need new people at regular intervals to prevent ourselves from stagnating. But this can only happen if other people are willing to leave.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber136"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber136" class="calibre2">26</a></sup></p>
