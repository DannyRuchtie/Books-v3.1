<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_4">“Jony Is Irreplaceable”</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Before he died, Jobs revealed the degree to which he empowered Jony inside the company. “He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me,” Jobs said. “There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That’s the way I set it up.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber369"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber369" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs didn’t explain exactly what he meant. According to Apple’s organization chart, Jony reports to Cook; yet, according to Jobs, Cook can’t tell him what to do. If such an arrangement seems unusual, it’s because Jony has enormous operational clout. His IDg, as the most powerful in the company, calls the shots with engineering and manufacturing. The company has invested billions in Jony’s demanding manufacturing methods. Budget and feasibility has never been a factor as Cook’s operations group implemented Jony’s IDg’s designs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For many years, Jony had transcended his role as IDg head, particularly by growing into his unusual partnership with Steve Jobs. Jobs saw Jony as a true collaborator and innovator.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He understands business concepts, marketing concepts. He picks stuff up just like that, click,” Jobs told Isaacson. “He understands what we do at our core better than anyone. If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, ‘Hey, what do you think about this?’ He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands that Apple is a product company. He’s not just a designer.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber370"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber370" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Friends and ex-friends alike acknowledge that Jony has carefully <a id="pageMap_265"></a>guarded his image as a soft-spoken English gentleman—but that’s he is also a practiced corporate player. Generous and protective as he may be of his IDg team, Jony has a healthy ego and isn’t shy about claiming personal credit for ideas or innovations. His jousts with Forstall and Rubinstein reveal another more aggressive facet of his character: He isn’t afraid to take on executive colleagues. To judge from the outcomes of the corporate contretemps that have come to light, Jony Ive possesses both the determination and the corporate firepower to prevail when he chooses to engage in such turf battles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the creative sphere, there’s little doubt that Jobs groomed Jony as his absolute successor, though without the CEO title. Cook would keep the trains running on time, but Jony, as the product champion, was endowed with operational muscle across the company.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The result has been that, in many ways, things have stayed the same. “We’re developing products in exactly the same way that we were two years ago, five years ago, ten years ago,” said Jony. “It’s not that there are a few of us working in the same way: there is a large group of us working in the same way.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber371"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber371" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony clearly seeks to maintain Jobs’s values: To Jony, as it was to Jobs, making “great products” is much more important than the balance sheet. “Our goal isn’t to make money,” Jony told a surprised audience at the British Embassy’s Creative Summit in July 2012. “Our goal absolutely at Apple is not to make money. This may sound a little flippant, but it’s the truth. Our goal and what gets us excited is to try to make great products. We trust that if we are successful people will like them, and if we are operationally competent we will make revenue, but we are very clear about our goal.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber372"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber372" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony explained that he learned this lesson from Jobs when Apple was poised to go under. “Apple was very close to bankruptcy and to irrelevance [but] you learn a lot about life through death, and I learnt a <a id="pageMap_266"></a>lot about vital corporations by experiencing a non-vital corporation,” he told the conference. “You would have thought that, when what stands between you and bankruptcy is some money, your focus would be on making some money, but that was not [Steve Jobs’s] preoccupation. His observation was that the products weren’t good enough and his resolve was, ‘We need to make better products.’ That stood in stark contrast to the previous attempts to turn the company around.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony is also committed to maintaining Jobs’s renowned focus. Jobs always said that focus isn’t a question of saying yes to projects; it’s saying no. Under Jony’s guidance, Apple has remained highly disciplined in “saying no” to products that are “competent” as opposed to “great.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production and in a room and realized we are talking a little too loud about the virtues of something. That to me is always the danger, if I’m trying to talk a little too loud about something and realizing I’m trying to convince myself that something’s good,” he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber373"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber373" class="calibre2">24</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Clive Grinyer, Jony’s first business partner, expressed confidence that Jony would catapult Apple to even greater heights.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony never was just the designer,” said Grinyer. “He always played a much more strategic role at Apple. That includes also the user interface, for which he also helped make the decisions. . . . Jony is now in the strategic position. I always felt very optimistic about Apple, because so much of Apple’s success has been due to Jony. Steve unlocked Jony. Steve took Jony away from printer lids and gave him the job he was capable of. . . . Steve gave Jony the confidence to bring out his innate design talent and create amazing products. And from now he will carry on as normal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apple was already a pretty amazing company, but the level they have reached in the last ten years is because they have had Jony, empowered by Steve, to produce that incredible panel of work.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber374"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber374" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_267"></a>Grinyer took his argument one step further. “Believe it or not, Jony’s leaving would be worse for Apple than Jobs’s leaving. Jony is irreplaceable. If he were to go, to get another design leader with that sense of humanity, vision, calmness and ability to keep the team together, would be impossible. Apple would become something different.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber375"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber375" class="calibre2">26</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Jony has said, “A big definition of who you are as a designer, it’s the way you look at the world. And I guess one of the curses of what you do, is you are constantly looking at something and thinking, ‘Why? Why is it like that? Why is it like that and not like this?’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber376"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber376" class="calibre2">27</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Very likely, as a man who see himself “constantly designing,” Jony Ive will continue to do precisely that at Apple into a future that will feature new designs, new products—and some happy surprises.</p>
