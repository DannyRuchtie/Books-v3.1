<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_5">Brunner Comes Calling</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Bob Brunner, whom Jony had met on his California trip several years earlier, paid a visit to Tangerine’s studio on Hoxton Street in fall 1991. Having left Lunar Design three years before, Brunner had settled in at Apple, and was now the head of ID. He’d built a killer team of hotshot designers (including several who would later play important roles in developing the iPod, iPhone and iPad).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner was scouting Europe for outside design firms to work with Apple on a secret project called Project Juggernaut. Even though it was officially taboo for a big company like Apple to use outside commissions to recruit talent, Brunner later admitted that was one of his goals.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I was trying to get Jony,” he admitted. “I wanted to get him to work on the project, and I thought it was another way to get him involved with the company.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber86"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber86" class="calibre2">30</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 1991, Apple was still riding high. The company had grown from a tiny start-up in Steve Jobs’s garage to one of the largest companies in the fast-growing PC industry. Steve Jobs was no longer at Apple, having quit six years earlier, and was now trying very hard to make his new company, NeXT, a success. His other company, Pixar, was also struggling although, four years later, it released its first film, <em class="calibre3">Toy Story</em>, which became a blockbuster.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_52"></a>Apple was being run by John Sculley, a former PepsiCo executive whom Steve Jobs had lured to the company with the immortal line: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?”<a id="SuperscriptNumber87"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber87" class="calibre2">31</a></sup> Sculley’s reputation is mixed these days, but at the time, he hadn’t yet put a wrong foot forward. Apple was huge, and the computer industry was exploding. The desktop publishing revolution was putting Macs in businesses all over the world. The company had just celebrated its first ever two-billion-dollar revenue quarter. <em class="calibre3">MacAddict</em> magazine proclaimed the era was “the first golden age of Macintosh.” Windows 1995 was still a few years in the future; no one could yet know that Microsoft’s operating system would entirely reshape the PC industry—and almost put Apple out of business.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Flush with cash, Apple was expanding its product lines. Sculley was investing Apple’s horde of $2.1 billion in cash in R&amp;D to speed up development of new products. He got a lot of attention for talking up a new line of innovative hyper-portable computers he called “personal digital assistants,” a term he coined at a major speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.<a id="SuperscriptNumber88"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber88" class="calibre2">32</a></sup> Although it would be a couple of years before Sculley’s PDA would actually hit the market as the Newton MessagePad, the IDg was hard at work on it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner’s design team was busy not only with the MessagePad but also a new line of PowerBooks. Although the first PowerBook hadn’t yet been released, Brunner’s design team was working on the second generation. The PowerBook was a revolution: the first “real” laptop in the fledgling PC industry, which had concentrated on desktop machines. However, the first PowerBook was big and heavy: It was more like a battery-powered desktop than a true portable computer and, for the design team, it’d been a nightmare. Brunner and his team had had to simultaneously invent, engineer, design and test the machine under a tight deadline.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_53"></a>Faced with the work of the next generation of products, Brunner was worried that the team was concentrating too much on the here and now, and not spending enough time looking at what might be coming up in the future. It was obvious that mobile was a new frontier, and Brunner wanted to see where it might go.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“As product schedules get tighter and the level of difficulty rises, the first casualty is innovation,” Brunner said. “I wanted to see design that was leaning forward . . . design that would predict what was coming rather than reflect what we already know and see.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber89"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber89" class="calibre2">33</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Attempting to keep the spirit of innovation alive, Brunner had started conducting offline projects—what he called “parallel design investigations.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The idea was to develop new form factors, new levels of expression and strategies for handling new technology without the pressure of a deadline,” he explained. Critically, Brunner wanted to keep this type of investigation “off-line” because it allowed his team to make mistakes, to feel separate enough from the grind of production that the creative juices could percolate. “Because the ideas generated off-line are often our best ideas, parallel design investigations can be extremely valuable,” he said. “This information not only enriches our language, it gives you something to point to and say ‘this is what we can move towards.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber90"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber90" class="calibre2">34</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That was a factor in his European trip: Brunner especially liked working with outside consultants (after all, he’d been one himself with Lunar Design before moving to Apple). “I decided to hire people from the consulting world so that IDg could function like a consultancy working with the speed and agility of an independent design firm,” he said. “In my experience, consultants want to build their portfolio and will compete to do the most interesting work. So I centered my search on the best local consultants and talented people, fresh out of school.” This description fitted Jony and Tangerine to a tee. Jony was only three <a id="pageMap_54"></a>years out of Newcastle and had impressed Brunner with his concept phone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As soon as he walked into the Hoxton studio, Brunner was excited by what he saw. He first laid eyes on a soda-making machine created by Grinyer for SodaStream, a British company. It had a swing door that opened and closed with a clever latch—the kind of hinge that, Brunner thought, might be adapted to the screen on a portable product. Brunner raved about it: “This is exactly the kind of creative thinking we’re looking for.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber91"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber91" class="calibre2">35</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner had something of his own to show the four London designers. He pulled a prototype PowerBook out of his bag. Phillips was impressed. “I had never seen that and it was incredible,” he said. Indeed, with its offset keyboard, centralized pointing device, and forward palm rests, the first PowerBook would set the standard for basic laptop design for the next twenty years, a fact that still surprises everyone. “We hit a homerun with the PowerBook,” Brunner said. “It surprised me to death. There were so many flaws with that machine and that design. I thought it was going to be a huge failure. But looking back today, basically all laptops are that design—a recessed keyboard, palm rests, a central pointing device.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before Brunner’s design, laptops had keyboards that were all the way forward and they didn’t have pointing devices. Most ran Microsoft’s MS-DOS, which relied on a command-line interface, rather than a graphical one like the Mac, and so used four-way cursor keys. There was no need for a pointing device and, as Windows took hold, manufacturers started using clip-on trackballs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s interesting, in retrospect, that from the PowerBook to today’s MacBook, it turned out to be almost the perfect design,” Brunner said. “No one’s been able to improve on it. . . . [W]e didn’t realize we already had something that was very difficult to move beyond.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_55"></a>Over the course of a few London meetings, Brunner and Tangerine exchanged ideas. Jony created a prototype mouse as a sort of test. The conversations went well and, as a result, Tangerine was given a contract to consult on Juggernaut.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was both excited and scared. The Apple job was a huge break for Tangerine and, he realized, for him personally too. He later recalled, “I still remember Apple describing this fantastic opportunity and my being so nervous that I would mess it all up.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber92"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber92" class="calibre2">36</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Brunner explained, Project Juggernaut was a wide-ranging parallel product investigation. The idea was to explore a suite of mobile products even further off in the future. Brunner and his team felt confident that the new PowerBook and Newton portable would kick off a whole range of mobile products. They began imagining noncomputer products, including digital cameras, personal audio players, small PDAs and bigger pen-based tablets. (These might sound familiar but fulfillment of these dreams wouldn’t come for at least another decade—and under the leadership of an entirely new regime.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They hoped that pen-based digital assistants, digital cameras and laptop computers could be linked together using infrared, radio wave and cellular networks. Brunner wanted the design group to have several mobile products ready in case Apple’s upper management suddenly decided the company needed to start making them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner had approached a couple of other outside design firms in addition to Tangerine, and he had some of Apple’s in-house designers working on concepts. “We knew certain things were coming,” explained Brunner. “We knew wireless was going to be important, and that image capture was going to be more important. Things were going to get smaller. Batteries were going to get better.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber93"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber93" class="calibre2">37</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While an Apple team in California worked on several concepts for portable products, the team at Tangerine designed four speculative <a id="pageMap_56"></a>products: a tablet, a tablet keyboard, and a pair of “transportable” desktop computers. Brunner wanted the products to be convertible; the tablet should convert into a laptop and vice versa. “For some reason, ironically, we thought convertibility would be really important,” explained Brunner. “So you could go from a traditional keyboard and mouse mode to a pen-based mode, which is a little bit of a rage today with some subnotebooks.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber94"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber94" class="calibre2">38</a></sup> Brunner noted that these ideas, which seemed a bit strange and radical in the early nineties, weren’t a million miles from the latest tablets and hybrid laptop/tablets for sale today.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner asked Jony and his Tangerine colleagues to push the boundary of the design but to keep the main elements of Apple’s then-current design language (mostly dark gray plastic with some soft bulges). The designs had to be based on real technology so they could conceivably be real products in the near future.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony, together with help from Grinyer and Darbyshire, worked on a tablet called the Macintosh Folio. It was a chunky, notebook-sized tablet with a pen-based screen and a huge built-in stand. Made of Apple’s then-usual dark gray plastic, it could almost be a predecessor to the iPad, despite being about five times thicker.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony worked alone on a special smart keyboard for the tablet called the Folio keyboard. But unlike today’s detachable keyboards for modern tablets, the Folio keyboard was conceived as an “intelligent keyboard” because it featured its own CPU, network jacks and a trackpad. In effect it was half a laptop, namely, the keyboard half.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Grinyer and Darbyshire worked on a pair of “transportable” desktops that were half desktop, half laptop. These were transformer-like computers, convertible machines with built-in keyboards and screens that could transform from a desktop into a portable and back again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One was the SketchPad. Made of light gray plastic, it featured an articulated screen that could be adjusted for height and tilt. It could be <a id="pageMap_57"></a>folded up into a purse-shaped bundle with a carrying handle for easy transport. (Jony would later revive the idea of a built-in carrying handle with the first iBook.)</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The second transportable desktop was called the Macintosh Workspace. It had a built-in, pen-sensitive screen, along with a split keyboard that folded underneath and to the sides when not in use. The Workspace could be folded flat—like a big fat tablet—for transporting, but spread its keyboard like a pair of chunky wings when opened for use.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I remember one day seeing Jony with this foam model of the tablet on his desk,” said Phillips. “He was sitting away from it with his knees up, typing away on this foam keyboard, and saying ‘this feels good.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber95"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber95" class="calibre2">39</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jon’s was the most thought provoking and, as ever, beautifully detailed,” recalled Darbyshire of the Folio. “He sweated and sweated to get it right and he did just that. It was stunning.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber96"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber96" class="calibre2">40</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With remarkable speed, Jony and the other designers on Project Juggernaut had developed about twenty-five models. In a matter of weeks, they presented the work to Brunner and his team and, over the next few months, the concepts were refined to four principal designs.<a id="SuperscriptNumber97"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber97" class="calibre2">41</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the project neared completion, Jony’s fears about messing it up almost came true. The fledgling company didn’t have its own model shop for making final prototypes, as such shops require special skills, tools and personnel, typically beyond the means of all but the biggest design studios. (Today, even a company as big as Apple uses external shops for finished models.) So the four Tangerine designers took their Juggernaut mock-ups to a local model maker who had done a lot of work with the film and advertising industry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The model maker was very talented and his models looked “fantastic,” said Grinyer. They were perfect for showing off their ideas to clients. However, the models weren’t made to last. “When we got the models back, they looked fantastic but would break after you had used <a id="pageMap_58"></a>them once,” said Grinyer. “Apple had this pile of broken models they couldn’t do anything with. That was all a bit of a disaster.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber98"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber98" class="calibre2">42</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite the rickety models, Brunner was mightily impressed with Jony’s contributions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony did a really, really sweet tablet,” said Brunner. “Really amazing. True to form with Jony, it was very clean, very sophisticated, super attention to detail. But still it had provocative qualities. . . . It was very developed, refined, sophisticated surfaces that were clean and beautiful but they still felt emotional. They weren’t dull and boring.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber99"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber99" class="calibre2">43</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner remembered that Jony’s Juggernaut designs stood out because they weren’t based on anything that Apple—or any other computer company—had done before. They were utterly original. “They had an emotional maturity that’s rare for someone Jonathan’s age,” Brunner added.<a id="SuperscriptNumber100"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber100" class="calibre2">44</a></sup> Jony was twenty-six at the time.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After six months of work on Project Juggernaut, Jony, Grinyer and Darbyshire were flown to Apple’s Cupertino headquarters to make a final presentation. Since Phillips hadn’t been involved in the day-to-day work on Juggernaut—he’d been keeping the company afloat working for LG—he stayed behind.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Both Jony and Grinyer liked the vibe at Apple, but Darbyshire found it cliquey. “Apple is a deep culture,” he said. “You have to want to belong to it. It’s almost to the point of being a cult, and I have to say I find that kinda spooky. There are fantastic sides to the culture as well: a great sense of freedom, constant encouragement to develop and look for something new to perfect, but also a slightly cliquey weird side that I find too claustrophobic. It’s almost a religion and I can’t deal with that.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber101"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber101" class="calibre2">45</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After the presentation, as they were packing up to go, Brunner pulled Jony to one side to speak to him privately. He told Jony that if he really <a id="pageMap_59"></a>wanted to “create something radical,” he should come to work for Apple full time.<a id="SuperscriptNumber102"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber102" class="calibre2">46</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It wasn’t super overt,” said Brunner. “It was more along the lines of me mentioning that the opportunity still exists, and him saying, ‘That’s pretty interesting, let me think about it.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber103"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber103" class="calibre2">47</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony did think about it, and back in London, he agonized over the decision. He had enjoyed working with Apple, but wasn’t sure if he wanted to leave both his homeland and his work at Tangerine. He also wasn’t sure whether his wife, Heather, would want to move to the States. But Project Juggernaut had opened a new window for Jony.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Even though I had done a lot of interesting work up to that time, the issues I encountered on Juggernaut were unlike anything I had dealt with before,” he said. “The principal challenge—to give personality and meaning to a technology that was still being treated as though it were anonymous—interested me a lot. Also important was the fact that Apple offers a supportive environment. It’s the kind of place where a designer can focus less on day-to-day business and more on design as a craft.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber104"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber104" class="calibre2">48</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But California was a long way from London. Trying to tip the balance, Brunner flew Jony and his wife, Heather, out to California for a second visit. On returning to London, however, Jony still couldn’t make up his mind.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The opportunity wasn’t a secret. Grinyer, Darbyshire and Phillips pushed him to move to California. ‘We all said, ‘It’s a great opportunity Jon, how can you not take it?’” said Darbyshire.<a id="SuperscriptNumber105"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber105" class="calibre2">49</a></sup> Phillips pointed out that the other partners all had children. They were “tied to London, and he [wasn’t], so it was a no brainer.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber106"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber106" class="calibre2">50</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ultimately, none of the Project Juggernaut designs would see the light of day. Even so, the project was instrumental in moving Apple away from its previous beige boxes. Key ideas like split keyboards and docking <a id="pageMap_60"></a>stations (an idea that later came to market as the duo dock), as well as the gray and black industrial design that Apple became famous for in the early 1990s, were by-products of Juggernaut thinking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It also became increasingly clear that, at least in part, Project Juggernaut was an elaborate ruse by Brunner to recruit Jony. “We always suspected that the project was given to Tangerine to try and lure Jony to the sunny climes of California to see if they could poach him over to the States,” said Phillips.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, Jony made the call. As he remembered, “through some sort of reckless sense of faith,” he got to Yes.<a id="SuperscriptNumber107"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber107" class="calibre2">51</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner had tried to hire Jony three times: when Jony first visited Lunar as a student, when Brunner first started at Apple and when Jony had just joined Tangerine and after Project Juggernaut. “He liked California,” said Brunner. “He liked the energy. So we managed to hire him on the third try. And that’s how you do it. You identify the people you think are great and work on it until you eventually get them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another factor was undoubtedly that Jony was frustrated with consulting. He had achieved what many designers dream of: a successful practice with a lot of freedom. But consulting also restricted his ability to truly make an effect. “Working outside a company made it difficult to have a profound impact on product plans and to truly innovate,” he said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber108"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber108" class="calibre2">52</a></sup> In most cases, by the time his commissions had been accepted, many of the critical decisions had already been made internally. Jony had come to believe that to do something fundamentally new required dramatic change from within an organization.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“While I had never thought that I could work successfully as part of a corporation—I always assumed that I would work independently—at the end of this big program of work for Apple, I decided to accept a full-time position there and to move to California.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber109"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber109" class="calibre2">53</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tangerine would continue to thrive without him, and work on <a id="pageMap_61"></a>projects for Apple, Ford and LG. The company is still running with Darbyshire in charge. In recent years, they are best known for their work on the British Airways flat bed, an innovative first-class seat that converts into a bed. Still, Jony Ive has gone on, left them for the world of Apple. His former partners remained philosophical, understanding that Jony couldn’t be kept back. Brunner tried to ease the loss too. Phillips reported, “Bob was very kind when Jon had gone and gave us a nice big beefy project to boot as a bit of a sweetener. It was a nice chunk of money to say ‘sorry.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber110"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber110" class="calibre2">54</a></sup></p>
