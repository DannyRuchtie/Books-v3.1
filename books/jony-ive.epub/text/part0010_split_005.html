<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_5">Power Mac Cube</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">In 2000, having filled all four of the 2×2 quadrants, Jony and the design group attempted their most ambitious product to date: the Power Mac Cube.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Cube was the team’s first shot at the ultimate computer, an attempt to cram the power of a desktop computer into a much smaller case. Jony saw putting a lot of components into a tower design as lazy: Why give the consumer a big ugly tower just because it’s the easiest option for the engineers and designers? They aimed to make the new machine by combining untested plastic casting with advanced miniaturization. Like many of Apple’s products, it was an exercise in simplification, removing everything that could be removed. It represented a major breakthrough in miniaturization, innovative design thinking and manufacturing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Cube was actually a rectangle formed from a single piece of crystal-clear plastic that was translucent at the base, giving the impression that the eight-inch Cube was suspended in air. It had a vertical slot-load DVD drive on the top, which popped up the DVD like a piece of toast. Some compared the Cube to a box of Kleenex. The analogy greatly amused Jony and the designers, and they took to using empty Cubes in the design studio as tissue dispensers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Cube used air convection for cooling instead of a noisy fan. Air entered through vents in the bottom and cooled the chips inside, exiting through vents in the top. It operated in virtual silence.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like the Power Mac G4 tower before it, access was a key consideration. The guts of the G4 Cube were designed to be easily removed for access <a id="pageMap_156"></a>to internal components; its entire core could be pulled out through the bottom with a beautifully made pop-up handle. To turn the Cube on, there was a touch-sensitive button that appeared to be printed on the surface of the transparent case. It seemed magical, as though the button floated in air, detached from the computer with no visible means of operation. It was an early use of capacitive touch (the technology that would eventually make the iPhone possible). Customers loved it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The new machine would be configured with a 450 MHz G4 chip, 64 MB memory and 20 GB storage. Priced at $1,799, the basic model included an optical mouse, pro keyboard and Apple-designed Harman Kardon stereo speakers, but no monitor. Also available exclusively on the Apple online store was a higher-spec model G4 Cube with a more powerful processor and additional memory and storage, which went for $2,299.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The Power Mac G4 Cube was a breakthrough product,” said Satzger. “It contained a lot of interesting new technology and beautiful mechanics. It was really exciting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some customers went crazy for the Cube. The Cube looked “sophisticated and expensive,” said the Ars Technica Web site.<a id="SuperscriptNumber236"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber236" class="calibre2">23</a></sup> “Holy s**t, they’ve done it again,” said Lee Clow, chief creative officer of TBWA/Chiat/Day.<a id="SuperscriptNumber237"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber237" class="calibre2">24</a></sup> But the public reaction to the new machines was cooler than Jony and Jobs had hoped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Consumers viewed the Cube as basically a mid-range Power Mac G4 tower at a higher price. It was $200 more expensive than a comparable G4, and didn’t come with a monitor. The price was a lot higher than anything in the Windows world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It also suffered from its own <em class="calibre3">Doonesbury</em> moment: The transparent case developed hairline cracks, an issue that got a lot of attention in the press. On some machines, tiny cracks appeared in the clear plastic case, especially around the DVD slot and a pair of screw holes in the top. It <a id="pageMap_157"></a>was a relatively minor cosmetic flaw, but it drove some customers crazy. “They are the worst kind of cosmetic problem,” wrote the Ars Technica Web site in its review. “Something that is not ‘important’ enough to really fix, but which will grate on those that care deeply about the appearance of their hardware . . . the very same people that are most attracted to a system like the Cube!”<a id="SuperscriptNumber238"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber238" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In September 2000, just a few months after the Cube’s debut, Apple announced sales were slower than expected. It was later revealed that Apple sold a paltry 150,000 units, only one-third of the volume Apple had projected. At the end of 2000, Apple reported earnings that were “substantially below expectations” for the last quarter, with a $600 million revenue shortfall.<a id="SuperscriptNumber239"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber239" class="calibre2">26</a></sup> It was Apple’s first unprofitable quarter in three years.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Apple watchers, the news was ominous. Despite a string of hits, Apple was still on shaky ground, battling powerful foes like Microsoft and Dell, which were at the peak of their power. “Frankly, I can’t say I’m surprised by these numbers at all, but they do show a much bleaker picture than what has been depicted in the press,” said Kevin Knox, an industry analyst at the Gartner group. He went further, concluding “They are disastrous.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber240"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber240" class="calibre2">27</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In July 2001, Apple issued a press release saying the Cube had been “put on ice.” It wouldn’t continue to be sold, but it wasn’t officially discontinued either; it was suspended. The release said there was “a small chance” an upgraded model of the computer would be introduced in the future. That never happened and, five years later, the Cube was replaced by the Mac mini, a much cheaper “headless” Mac, which clearly targeted first-time, budget-conscious consumers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For Jony’s group, the Cube didn’t represent all bad news. Though the machine performed poorly in the marketplace, it had its admirers internally because it represented breakthroughs in manufacturing techniques and miniaturization.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_158"></a>The machine reflected a new mastery of packing desktop components into laptop-sized spaces, which would be crucial in making the dome-shaped iMac and later flat-screen models. Just as important, it pushed Apple into new manufacturing techniques that would benefit later products like the iPod. Satzger explained: “Basically, we did not accept standard molding practice in plastics. We started getting into machining plastic. On the Cube, the screw holes and the vent hole were precision machined.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Such machining would come to define products like the MacBook and iPad, which are machined out of slabs of aluminum. The Cube was an early foray into machining products on a mass scale. In a wider context, the machining experiments represented a fundamental shift in how products are mass produced.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“For a long time at Apple, the engineering team often told the designers, ‘You can’t do that,’” said Satzger. “But the design team challenged everything—with plastics, metal, every material.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Even though the Cube didn’t sell well and even became a symbol of form over function, its creation spoke for the growing power and influence within Apple of Jony Ive and his design team.</p>
