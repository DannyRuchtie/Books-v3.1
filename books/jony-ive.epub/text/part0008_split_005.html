<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_5">Project Pomona</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jony’s next big project was the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, which would be the first major project to get started within the design group rather than one of Apple’s engineering groups. “At its best, engineering <a id="pageMap_85"></a>and design would work hand in hand,” Brunner explained. “Other times they would come to us and say, This is the product, just make it look pretty. It was already defined, you just need to put your styling on it. That was Apple at its worst.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner wanted Project Pomona to signal a shift in development.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This was one when it wasn’t engineering driven at all. It was design driven. It was all about a certain type of experience that we saw and thought was important.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Launched in 1992, Project Pomona would be one of Brunner’s parallel design investigations. Just like the Juggernaut project, Pomona involved the whole IDg, along with a few freelance designers. The ambition was large: Project Pomona aimed to imagine the first computer designed for the home, rather than the workplace. The end result would be a triumph—and a disaster.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By the early nineties, more and more computers were being used in people’s homes, but they were mostly beige boxes that had been designed for office cubicles. Brunner wanted to change that. “For years I wondered how the computer would evolve from a box into something more physically compelling that would fit better in the home,” said Brunner. His hope was that his team would come up with “concepts that would encourage people to select their computer the same way they would a piece of furniture or a home stereo.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber138"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber138" class="calibre2">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner also wanted to move away from the heavy, oversized CRT monitors standard on desktop computers. Instead, he wanted to fuse a desktop CPU with a flat-panel display. “We thought that flat panels would become mainstream; they were already mainstream on laptops.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner’s October 1992 briefing document laid out his ideas and criteria for a high-design desktop Mac. It was, in effect, a challenge to the group’s designers and five outside consultants to come up with the best concepts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_86"></a>Brunner kept it loose: His basic call was for a high-design desktop Mac, powerful but with a minimum footprint. Brunner insisted that all concepts use new materials in new ways, including polished or brushed metal, wood, veneer and different types of coatings and finishes. Not only were there a minimum of other restrictions; the designers were actually invited to step outside of Apple’s established design language.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner did add another interesting wrinkle to the project: He wanted a machine that couldn’t be expanded with extra hardware cards and beefier internal components. Most home users never bothered to expand their machines, so he encouraged designers to forget expansion slots, freeing them to explore much thinner designs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The initial concepts were wildly varied. One was inspired by the design of a classic Tizio lamp, with the guts housed in the base and the screen mounted on an arm that hovered in space. Another concept hid the main display and components inside a metallic exoskeleton.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of the most intriguing concepts came from Jony and Daniele De Iuliis, who teamed up to pitch a mid-range computer. Their design had a homely look and their goal was to create a machine affordable for those with a modest budget. They called it the “Domesticated Mac.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To keep the price down, they based it on a CRT monitor, not a pricier flat screen. It was basically a Classic Mac in a funky-looking case. It was an odd duck, resembling an old-fashioned wardrobe, with three feet and twin doors that covered the display. There were slots inside the doors for things like extra floppy disks. Jony and De Iuliis also put an analog clock in one of the doors. Cleverly installed, the clock would flip around so that it told the time when the door was open or closed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner created his own Pomona project design. His concept closely aligned with his prescription for a futuristic computer with a slim profile and powerful components. Brunner designed a wide, curved enclosure <a id="pageMap_87"></a>containing a flat-panel display flanked by a pair of big stereo speakers. It was a computer-cum-stereo, perfect for the kind of multimedia experience promised by CD-ROMs, then new to the market. To keep it slim, he proposed to use the guts from a PowerBook notebook. It would be made from—of all things—black mahogany, like a concert piano.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Since the other designers thought his concept looked more like a product from the high-end audio maker Bang &amp; Olufsen than a PC, Brunner’s solution became the “B&amp;O Mac.” The mating of a PC and stereo system was a novel idea at the time, and it generated a lot of excitement in the design studio. In fact, Brunner’s concept would trounce all other Pomona designs in focus groups in the summer of 1993 and, by the end of the project, was declared the winner of the Pomona competition.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nearly a year had passed since Brunner released his brief, but the group had a good idea of the basic shape and scope of the project. So far so good.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To turn it into a real product, Brunner handed the project over to Jony in the summer of 1993. Jony had just finished his work on the Lindy MessagePad 110 and, when handed the B&amp;O Mac by Brunner, he knew he was facing a tough challenge. Going back to basics, he started with the design story.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“On a technical level, we understood the challenges associated with packaging a lot of components into a very slim space,” Jony recalled later. “But philosophically, the project was more challenging. Like the first Macintosh, the design had no predecessors, which meant I had to come up with a new meaning for the product. I wanted the design to be simple almost to the point of being invisible.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber139"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber139" class="calibre2">29</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ultimately, Jony would keep the spirit of Brunner’s concept but change almost everything else. He redesigned the proportions of the computer. Where Brunner’s initial design was wide and curved and <a id="pageMap_88"></a>appeared to take over a desk, Jony made it taller and much narrower. He changed the size of the foot of the base (which was called the bale) and created a hinge that allowed the foot to double as a carrying handle. Handles would feature prominently in Jony’s designs. He redesigned the back panel, giving more room to the CPU and motherboard.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In April 1994, after working on it all winter, Jony handed over his design to a pair of product design engineers to make a working prototype. As the prototype took shape, a marketing manager worked up an internal product brief. The machine gained the official code name “Spartacus.” After eighteen months, everything was on track to turn it into a real product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then Spartacus stumbled into its first major hurdle. To keep it slim, Jony had planned to use components from the portable PowerBook, only to find the working prototype was seriously underpowered. Portable components then lagged behind their desktop counterparts by at least a generation, so Spartacus seemed painfully slow. In particular, video was poor and, because of the flat profile, the circuitry couldn’t be enhanced with a souped-up video expansion card like its cousins in the desktop department. This loomed as a major liability because Spartacus was to be sold as a desktop computer. Consumers would expect nothing less than desktop performance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony moved to a regular desktop circuit board (developed for the Performa 6400), but a new problem arose when the marketing department told him that no one would buy a desktop machine unless it could accommodate expansion cards. Even if Brunner was right about home users, the marketing experts advised that an un-expandable desktop would be commercial suicide. To accommodate a pair of expansion cards, Jony was forced to design a special clip-on “hunchback” that covered any cards the user might add. Dubbed internally the “backpack,” the add-on would ship with every machine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_89"></a>“With the original back in place, the design is powerful yet physically lean,” Jony would say. “But with the backpack inserted, it becomes a real power system, expressing on the outside the enhanced function contained on the expansion card inside.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber140"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber140" class="calibre2">30</a></sup> That may sound like designer doublespeak, but Jony tried to put a brave face on what was obviously a horrible kludge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Despite the misshapen hunchback, the design team became quite excited by the prospects of Spartacus. For an executive presentation in 1994, the group rustled up bigger and smaller versions, showing how the concept might be extended into a whole family of desktop products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At every step, they faced resistance from the engineers. “There were layers and layers of middle managers, many who had come from Dell or HP and didn’t understand the design-driven approach,” Brunner explained. “They were accustomed to slapping a cheap metal skin on a product, because that was the way they did it at Dell, and Dell sold a lot of computers. They didn’t really believe in what we were doing, and the very senior management of the company at the time didn’t step in. So that made for a fight at the second and third levels.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eventually, Brunner figured that to get any traction, he would personally have to become the machine’s product manager. “It didn’t come out of one of the product groups, and it wasn’t going anywhere,” said Brunner. “There was this process at Apple, where they decided if something was going to get on the product road map. There was a presentation that you needed to put together and a group you needed to present to. I acted like a product marketing guy and presented this idea and got it off the ground.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Spartacus was finalized for market, it was discovered that the integrated speakers presented a major problem: When the volume was cranked up, the internal CD-ROM skipped. The skipping vexed the team for several months until an engineer from Bose suggested a solution. He <a id="pageMap_90"></a>recommended the use of a much smaller pair of speakers on the desktop and adding a subwoofer on the floor, which could also accommodate the machine’s power brick. The fix worked, and the machine could deliver room-filling audio with only forty watts of power.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Making the changes meant a new working prototype wasn’t ready until December 1995. Then it was decided to add a newer, updated circuit board, and a larger liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. In June 1996, Prototype Two finally emerged.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To Jony and the rest of the design team, who had lived with various prototypes for more than three years, the dark gray enclosure with mahogany trim had begun to look old. They had other doubts too. “Some of us felt the color was too strong,” Jony recalled. “But we had all looked at the concept so much, we couldn’t decide what color it should be.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber141"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber141" class="calibre2">31</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">An outside color consultancy was hired. They came up with the brilliant suggestion that the designers shouldn’t focus on the color of the computer; they should look at the color of the environments it would be put in. To find the right color, the consultants put together several palettes of cloth, wood, leather and carpeting, representing the colors found in a typical home. Several prototypes were painted and compared to each palette under different lighting conditions. A dozen options became three and, finally, just one, a metallic green/gold. Thanks to the metallic sheen, the bronze color had a chameleon-like effect that reflected the colors around it, helping it blend into any room. The mahogany accents were switched to black leather, which would likely wear better than wood.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Initially, the design department loved the final result. They thought it was a great all-purpose computer with good entertainment options in a high-end, high-quality proposition. This latest model included a TV/FM tuner, which allowed it to transform from computer to stereo to TV. Tim Parsey summarized the effects and qualities of the machine: “It’s really <a id="pageMap_91"></a>complicated geometrically. But it doesn’t look complicated. From the front, the design is quite simple. Yet it embraces the user in a powerful way. It’s incredibly thin, yet the back tells you that it’s strong enough to support itself with ease. And every curve and detail has a purpose.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony saw a deeper virtue, observing that “it challenges our perceptions in a fundamental way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In August 1996, the third working prototype finally rolled off an actual production line, proving the machine could be made in quantity. In September, tooling was completed and the final design was finished in December 1996. It was more than four years since Brunner had written his conceptual brief.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With the much-anticipated twentieth anniversary of the Macintosh approaching, the decision was made to designate Spartacus as a special edition. Officially named the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, the new product was limited to a run of just twenty thousnd units. Apple unveiled it at Macworld in January 1997 and the first two units were given to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who had just returned to the company as advisers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To make it more memorable, the machine was hand-delivered to customers’ homes by specially trained “concierges,” who set up the machines, installed any expansion cards (along with the ugly hunchback) and showed users how to use them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think it is the first sensible computer design that we have seen in a long time,” said Henry Steiner, Hong Kong’s most eminent graphic designer. “It is quite beautiful and desirable. It has the status value of a Porsche. The fact that the machine combines computer, television and stereo system is impressive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like the MessagePad, the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM) won not only kudos but awards, including the Best of Category prize for <em class="calibre3">I.D.</em> magazine’s Annual Design Review.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_92"></a>Steve Wozniak thought it was the perfect college machine “with the computer, TV, radio, CD player and more (AV even) all in one sleek machine.” He had several at his mansion in the hills of Los Gatos above Silicon Valley. By the time the machine was pulled from the market one year after launch, however, Wozniak seemed to be the only person on the planet who liked it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The TAM bombed in the marketplace. The machine widely missed its mark. Originally priced at $9,000, within a year the list dropped to under $2,000. It was originally intended as a mainstream product, but the marketing group turned it into a pricey special edition. It was the last straw. After all the battles to get the TAM to market, Brunner had grown tired of Apple’s dysfunctional culture.</p>
