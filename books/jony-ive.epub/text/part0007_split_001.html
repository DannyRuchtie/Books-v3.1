<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">Roberts Weaver Group</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">True to his promise to return to the Roberts Weaver Group, Jony, along with wife Heather, moved from Newcastle to London. His decision to join Roberts Weaver came as something of a surprise to his new boss, Phil Gray, who knew of his other job offers. “He was already being recognized as a very talented ‘Young Designer,’” said Gray. “As an honorable person, he accepted our offer—even though he had plenty of other offers at the time.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Joining RWG was more than a consolation prize; Roberts Weaver was one of the top design firms in Britain. Jony joined a talented team and <a id="pageMap_34"></a>quickly made friends, establishing some relationships that survive today. His friend Grinyer had moved on at that point, quitting to join another design firm near Cambridge, but RWG won several design awards in the late eighties.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like a lot of consultancies of its kind, the company worked on a wide portfolio of projects, from consumer goods to high-tech products, working for international clients in the United States, Europe, Japan and South Korea. Major clients included Applied Materials, Zebra and Qualcast, a lawn mower manufacturer. The management and production structure at RWG, typical of firms at the time, comprised three different groups working together: product design, interior design and a workshop. Jony was assigned to the product team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His coworkers comprised twenty designers, engineers and graphic designers working in an open studio. Jony and his colleagues had quick access to a workshop, which was directly below. It was a fully equipped model-making facility, with five on-staff model makers. The interior design team had twenty-three designers, architects and computer specialists.<a id="SuperscriptNumber62"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber62" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">RWG took on two basic types of product design projects, according to partner Barrie Weaver. One was a full design and development process, typically for clients in the United Kingdom. Such projects involved developing the product concept, producing finished working models, undertaking much of the engineering development and overseeing tooling—in short, taking the project through to production. The second kind of project was more limited, focusing on the generation of new ideas or products, usually for foreign clients, most of them in Japan and Korea. In most such cases, the client company had its own in-house design team but was looking for fresh concepts or a different approach from the outside.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It is important to understand that our projects were done on very <a id="pageMap_35"></a>tight time frames and fees,” Weaver said of this time at RWG. “If we did not undertake the project efficiently then the business would lose money. This therefore makes decision making prompt and restricts time to be spent on analysis, research, ethnography, societal opportunities, etc.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In his new workplace, Jony was as productive as he had been at Newcastle. “Some designers believe the more research you do, the better the solution,” said Weaver. “I personally believe in common sense and intuition. Jonathan’s strength was that he quickly grasped the essentials of a challenge, producing intuitive solutions, which were elegant, viable and had a sense of detail rare in one so young.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He gained the confidence of his coworkers as an enthusiastic, hardworking team player. “He was a quiet character, with a lovely sense of humor,” Gray recalled. “He was not by any means a loud person in the studio. He was very productive and got on with his tasks. He worked incredibly hard and was very diligent. His productivity was amazing, with consummate quality. He really was prolific. He often would produce half a dozen great ideas in a very short space of time and was not only able to talk about them but could articulate them through some very good draftsmanship.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber63"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber63" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While Jony’s style seemed to suit RWG, the nature of doing business as a consultancy didn’t. As an outside firm, RWG often had to make concessions to its clients, something that would soon begin to drive Jony crazy. “It is important to understand that there are other aspects which come into play when you are a consultant,” Weaver explained. “The client has the final say—they are paying!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the other hand, Weaver clearly understood his designer’s frustration. “Sadly, clients’ marketing teams often have what I would call dubious taste and force changes upon the design. In consequence you end up with some projects of which you are proud and others which are a compromise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_36"></a>As part of the design pool, Jony collaborated with the other designers. He worked on outdoor garden lighting and lawn mowers for the UK manufacturer Qualcast. He created several conceptual designs for industrial power drills for another British company, Kango.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His confidence grew rapidly and, after just a few weeks at RWG, he asked Gray for a substantial raise: He was talented and felt he deserved it. But he was also young, just out of school, and Gray had to coach the young upstart on the reality of raises.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I had to balance the interests of the business,” said Gray. “I had to have a very difficult discussion. I had to explain he was on a journey, on a career path. There were others around. Everyone had various strengths and weaknesses. We had to balance the books in terms of making sure everyone got a fair opportunity. That fell upon me to do that. It wasn’t a pleasant experience because one doesn’t like to disappoint people. But we had a rational discussion. He went away. I think he felt he didn’t get the best end of the deal. On the other hand, he didn’t sulk. He just carried on.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His talents, however, presented other challenges to his managers at RWG. In 1989, Jony’s classroom hearing aid project had been featured in the high-profile Young Designers Exhibition, run by the UK Design Council. The futuristic work came to the attention of an executive at Ideal Standard, a giant in bathroom and toilet fixtures in the United Kingdom. The sales director at Ideal Standard was so impressed with Jony’s work that he approached Roberts Weaver and asked that Jony be assigned to work on a particular design project for the company. Roberts Weaver felt obliged to decline the request.<a id="SuperscriptNumber64"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber64" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We had a studio of twelve designers and there was no way we could send a fresh graduate such as Jony to go and work with one of our clients,” said Gray. “So we responded to Ideal Standard that they could give us a design brief, which we would fulfill, but it was our decision as <a id="pageMap_37"></a>to which of our designers we would assign to do the work. When he heard this, he walked away! He specifically wanted Jony to do the project.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In time, the Ideal Standard executive would reemerge on Jony’s horizon. But in 1989, the savings and loan banking crisis took a toll on RWG’s business. The company’s interior design group had been getting numerous commissions to design dealing rooms for banks in the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia. But as the financial crisis spread around the world, the banks canceled. “With the financial crisis, banks terminated projects leaving our designers without work,” recalled Weaver. “At the same time, the lack of credit meant UK manufacturers pulled back on their new product development programs.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber65"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber65" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">RWG had to close down the interior design operation in London. Weaver’s business partner, Jos Roberts, left, moving to Australia, and the product design team was restructured. As part of the restructuring, Weaver drew up new contracts for all the designers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">None of the designers would sign the new contract—except Jony. And he only signed it because the new contract invalidated his old contract, which had married him to RWG because they had sponsored him through college. As a result of the freshly opened legal loophole, his obligation ended. He quit RWG, the first phase of his professional life at an end.</p>
