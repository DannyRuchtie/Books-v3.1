			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Even without Steve Jobs at hand to challenge him, Jony in 2012 remained a busy and engaged man. In March, Apple announced the <a id="pageMap_259"></a>third-generation iPad, called simply the “new iPad.” It would have the strongest launch of all previous iterations of the device, selling three million units over the first weekend.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPhone 5 was announced several months later, in September 2012. Redesigned with a bigger, four-inch retina display, the iPhone 5 was “the most beautiful consumer device that we’ve ever created,” said Phil Schiller. Preorders of the new phone topped two million in the first twenty-four hours after the announcement; upon its release on September 21, the phone set a new record with weekend sales of over five million units, and demand exceeded supply for several weeks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One month after the iPhone 5, Apple announced the release of the second new iPad within the same year, along with its little cousin, the iPad mini, a tablet computer with a smaller, 7.9 inch display. In November, the two new tablets were released simultaneously in thirty-four countries and, between them, sold three million units in just three days. The surprise iPad was unusual because Apple’s normal release schedule didn’t shift significantly. Products came no quicker than they had before.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The new products proved a further boon to Apple’s stock. Within days after their release, Apple’s share price rose over 12 percent, from $505 to $568, and continued to climb thereafter.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple seemed to be gaining strength—there was no sign the company was suffering from the loss of Steve Jobs. On the contrary, it was a period of incredible financial and creative fecundity. But on October 29, 2012, Apple announced a surprise executive reshuffle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In a press release that seemed calculated to obfuscate what was really going on behind the scenes, Apple announced a major shift of executive offices. To put it more bluntly than the Apple communications did, Scott Forstall was fired from his role as head of iOS and Jony was promoted to overall creative head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_260"></a>Jony would maintain his position of senior vice president of ID, but henceforth would also “provide leadership and direction for Human Interface across the company.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber360"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber360" class="calibre2">11</a></sup> In other words, Jony would be in charge of the all-important product interfaces in both hardware and software, a role previously fulfilled by Steve Jobs. “Jony has an incredible design aesthetic and has been the driving force behind the look and feel of our products for more than a decade,” said Cook in a follow-up e-mail to employees. “The face of many of our products is our software and the extension of Jony’s skills into this area will widen the gap between Apple and our competition.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber361"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber361" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When parsed carefully, Cook was saying, in short: The man who had long been responsible for setting the direction for Apple’s hardware would now be given the power to reimagine its software as well. Although Apple chose to neither confirm nor deny them, rumors had it that Forstall was ousted over fallout with Jony over user-interface design. The departure of Forstall and Jony’s increased responsibilities strongly suggested that Forstall lost a power struggle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A key contention concerned Forstall’s fondness for skeuomorphic design; that is, graphic interfaces that resemble real-world objects. Apple’s user-interface conventions under Forstall tended to look like their real-life counterparts. Virtual wooden shelves were used to display eBooks in the iBookstore app; Apple’s Podcast app looked like a reel-to-reel tape recorder; iOS’s multiplayer gaming service, Game Center, was styled like a Vegas casino table. Faux leather and wood-grain patterns had found their way into many of Apple’s most popular apps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Such skeuomorphic design allows neophyte users to be immediately familiar with an unfamiliar device, operating on the assumption that nothing is simpler than an interface that works exactly like objects do in the real world. The original Macintosh desktop computer, for example, was conceived as a skeuomorphic version of an office desktop as seen <a id="pageMap_261"></a>from above. Because everybody knew how the items on a traditional desk were used in the physical world, that knowledge could be implicitly transferred to its digital counterpart.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">More recently, however, Apple had heard loud criticisms concerning its use of “tacky” skeuomorphic elements. According to some, visual references to obsolescent office furniture and audio equipment were beginning to look dated and out of place. Forstall, after Jobs’s death, was reportedly Apple’s major champion of skeuomorphic design, which put him in the line of fire not only in the eyes of external critics but from some within Apple too.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony Ive was never a fan of skeuomorphism, according to one unnamed Apple designer speaking to the <em class="calibre3">New York Times</em>.<a id="SuperscriptNumber362"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber362" class="calibre2">13</a></sup> In an interview with the UK’s <em class="calibre3">Telegraph</em>, Jony visibly “winced” when the subject came up, but refused to be drawn into a detailed discussion. “My focus is very much working with the other teams on the product ideas and then developing the hardware and so that’s our focus and that’s our responsibility,” he said. “In terms of those elements you’re talking about, I’m not really connected to that.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber363"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber363" class="calibre2">14</a></sup> Cook’s reshuffle corrected that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple’s management shake-up represented a major design shift in software and, by the time iOS 7 was released in 2013, most of Forstall’s skeuomorphic references were nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The mobile software was flat and modern looking. Gone were references to felt and leather, as well as 3-D effects like highlights and shadows. “No virtual cows were harmed in the making of this,” joked Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, as he showed off iOS 7’s calendar app during the launch event. He added that other apps were cleaner, too, because “We just completely ran out of green felt. And wood too. This has to be good for the environment.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber364"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber364" class="calibre2">15</a></sup> The iOS 7 design was minimal, bearing a curious resemblance to the phony operating system that Jony’s group used when designing the <a id="pageMap_262"></a>iPhone and iPad hardware in the mid-2000s. They had the same flat look, and some of the icons were very similar. The reversion back to the mock-up OS hinted at the animosity between Jony and Forstall, suggesting that Jony’s instincts for software design had been downplayed to Forstall’s for several years.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the other side of the calculation, Jony’s overhaul of iOS was consistent with his approach to hardware. Jony’s hardware has always been about bare, utilitarian minimalism. He disdains decoration—as he says, every tiny screw is there for a reason—and his goal is to make design disappear. In contrast, skeuomorphism is about making software look like something it isn’t, like a roulette table or a yellow legal pad, and decoration is essential. Skeuomorphic software is the opposite of Jony’s minimalist hardware. One strips away everything that isn’t necessary; the other puts it back in.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This paradox within Apple ended with iOS 7. With the ornamentation taken out, Jony’s software was in sync with his hardware, stripped to their essentials. In addition, iOS 7 showed good design taste, especially in the use of typography. It featured a typeface called Helvetica Neue, a fine, detailed Swiss-designed typeface that’s enabled by the detailed retina displays of Apple’s latest devices. The entire operating system was infused with a deep appreciation for print-graphic design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Apple’s mobile devices mature, the shift to put Jony in charge of hardware and software is hugely significant. Jony and his design team will continue to improve the hardware, but changes are likely to be incremental, not fundamental. There are only so many ways a thin glass rectangle can evolve. These days, the design frontier is software, not hardware.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sally Grisedale, the fellow Brit who worked with Jony in the mid-nineties, said Jony has always been adept at software. “[Jony and OS design] are a perfect fit,” she said. “It was always about the hardware <a id="pageMap_263"></a>software integration. . . . This whole piece of hardware-software interaction is the most exciting arena and he has sort of been leading the way for years. This is not new for him; he has always thought that way and it was just a question of scale and scope. Perfect fit.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber365"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber365" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Larry Barbera, one of Jony’s old design colleagues, also thought Jony was well equipped to refresh Apple’s software. But he also pointed out the need for him to build relationships with programmers. Despite being immersed in the software side of the business for years, Barbera said, “Jony needs to evangelize the software folks by creating a vision for all to buy in to. I’m sure that half of Jony’s battles will be in winning over the hearts and minds of the software folks.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber366"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber366" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s appointment to software came at a crucial time. Apple’s competitors are catching up, as the Android continues to mature and attract the kind of user who likes more control and more choices. Microsoft’s Windows 8 won plaudits for its clean, ambitious touch interface. “This is a defining moment, where hardware fulfills its promise and simply gets out of the way,” wrote Alex Schleifer, design and creative director at Say Media, a San Francisco advertising company. “A shape of glass existing solely to contain an experience. The user interface will be how we remember a device, fondly or not. The way it looks and reacts. It will live in our cars and living rooms, become part of the architecture, cover our landscapes. It will affect the media we consume, the way we look at the world, and how we learn and communicate. Here’s to the age of the user interface.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber367"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber367" class="calibre2">18</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In an interview published in <em class="calibre3">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, Cook shed little light on the top-level changes and direction at Apple, beyond deflecting inquiries with some standard Cook-style remarks: “Creativity and innovation are something you can’t flowchart out. You know, small teams do amazing things together. Collaboration is essential for innovation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He did, however, go as far as to opine warmly that “I don’t think <a id="pageMap_264"></a>there’s anybody in the world that has better taste than Jony Ive does.” Cook added, “Jony and I both love Apple. We both want Apple to do great things.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber368"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber368" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
