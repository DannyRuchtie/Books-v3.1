<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">Making the Change</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Several months earlier, Jony had laid out all of the parts of a dismantled MacBook Pro on top of one of the big display tables in the design studio at Apple. On the table next to it he had spread out the parts of one of the new unibody MacBooks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_242"></a>Arranged neatly, the parts of the old MacBook Pro took up almost the entire tabletop. In contrast, the many fewer parts of the unibody machine made for a striking comparison. Jony called his designers over to appreciate the difference.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As part of his characteristic drive to reduce and simplify, Jony wanted to reduce the number of parts and therefore the number of part-to-part joints. Previously, when IDg had done a similar dismantling of an original iPhone, the team counted nearly thirty interfaces where parts meet. After the iPhone underwent a unibody makeover, the number of interfaces shrank to just five.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony and his team had initiated the process that led to the unibody much earlier. They’d first explored machining—a manufacturing process that removes raw material to make a part, that may involve drilling, turning, boring and so on—in 2001 with the Power Mac G4 Quicksilver and slowly increased its use with subsequent products like the Cube, Mac mini and various aluminum iPods. But Jony’s team got really serious about machining in 2005 for the iPhone. At that time, they visited various watch manufacturers to see how precise, long-lasting time-keeping products were made.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We started researching watch companies just to understand machining metals, finishing metals, product assembly,” recalled Satzger.<a id="SuperscriptNumber339"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber339" class="calibre2">3</a></sup> What they found was a remarkably high standard of manufacturing. Most importantly, they realized the watch industry used highly machined parts in their high-end products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While the solution made sense, the Apple investigators also learned that watches are made in relatively small batches. But now the plan gradually evolved to go full bore and use machining as the main manufacturing process for all of Apple’s major products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL"><a id="pageMap_243"></a>The “unibody process” is a blanket name for a number of machining operations. Machining in general has long been time- and labor-intensive. It relies on big, slow machines like drills and milling machines, but modern CNC machines have greatly sped up and automated the process.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Traditionally, machining has rarely been used in mass production, which is more likely to rely on fast and efficient methods like stamping and molding to turn out products in the millions. Machining is usually associated with one-shot products or small batches. The prototypes made in Jony’s design studio are machined, individually carved using CNC milling machines. In industry, machining has usually been employed only by specialized manufacturers with high standards and deep pockets; think aerospace, defense, high-end watches and designer cars, like the Aston Martin. It is the way to make the best parts possible, the pinnacle of refinement and precision. But it takes time and money.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Machining enables a level of precision that is just completely unheard of in this industry,” said Jony. “We have been so fanatical in the tolerances of how we machine and build these products, in many ways I think it is more beautiful internally than it is externally. I think that testifies to just our care, to how much we care.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber340"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber340" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony saw the unibody process as the key to shrinking the iPhone, iPad and MacBook. In all of these products, a single part forms the back plate and the frame. All the screw bosses are cut into it, for attaching other components, and condensing even more parts into one. Unibody allowed Jony’s team to make the iPhone 5 about three millimeters thinner than the iPhone 4S. That may not sound like much, but it trimmed about 30 percent of the thickness off an already thin product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For a laptop body, the first part of the process is to create a block of extruded aluminum from a billet (a big round tube) of raw aluminum. <a id="pageMap_244"></a>The billet is put through a giant hot press that, as if making flat noodles from a ball of dough, creates an extrusion into a sheet of aluminum.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The aluminum sheet then begins a trip through thirteen separate milling operations to get it into its final shape. The metal is cut into rectangular blocks the size of the laptop. It goes into the first CNC machine, where a laser drill creates a series of registration holes that guide the next cutting operation, a rough “hogging out” that removes the majority of the unwanted material.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This step is followed by a series of increasingly precise milling operations that create the finished part. The key caps and input ports are cut out. Screw bosses are cut and internal struts and ribs are shaped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next stage is the laser drilling of perforations for indicator lights. The inside of the case, where the light will be located, is milled thin enough to allow a laser drill to perforate minute holes through the metal. The laser drill is extremely accurate and fast, vaporizing metal with each pulse. The perforations are so tiny, the metal appears to be solid from the outside, but in actuality, they’re big enough to allow the LED behind to shine through. It’s an innovative practice for building magic into the product through precision.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is intriguing about that small design detail, is it is a phenomenal piece of design,” said designer Chris Lefteri. “An obvious thing to do there would be to make a hole in the metal, insert an LED, and place a piece of plastic over the top. Although that would do the job adequately, what Apple did instead was machine a series of virtually invisible holes in the body of the computer, so that suddenly lights appeared inside the holes. That is a craftsman-like approach to the industrial production process.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber341"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber341" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The laser drills are also used to make speaker grilles and other small openings, before a blast of fluid clears any debris. Apple uses lasers to etch serial numbers and other technical info onto the case, and may use <a id="pageMap_245"></a>them to inscribe personal inscriptions on the backs of iPods. Because there’s no physical contact with the aluminum, the “drills” used for this process never dull or wear out, and they are easily configured and reconfigured through the CNC controls.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After laser drilling, the unibody is passed to a CNC grinding machine that smooths burrs, rough patches and any surface imperfections. The cases are then “blast finished”—sprayed with dry particulates such as ceramic, silica, glass or metal under high pressure—to give the surfaces a textured, matte finish. Then the part is anodized, clear coated or polished, depending on the finish.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The entire unibody process is very much a trade secret, so Apple reveals few details. How much of the process is automated is not clear, though at least part of the assembly is done by robots. While most Apple products have been assembled by hand by legions of workers, it appears the unibody process may enable the company to shift toward automated assembly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a lot of focus on robotics and robotic control,” said a former mechanical engineer who worked as a liaison among ID, product development and operations, and spent months in the factories. The engineer declined to elaborate, citing confidentiality agreements, but said that many of Apple’s products are now primarily made and finished on CNC machines with robots moving parts between machining cycles.<a id="SuperscriptNumber342"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber342" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have literally seen buildings where as far as the eye can see, where you can see machines carving, mostly aluminum, dedicated exclusively for Apple at Foxconn,” said Guatam Baksi, a product design engineer at Apple from 2005 to 2010. “As far as the eye can see.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber343"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber343" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
