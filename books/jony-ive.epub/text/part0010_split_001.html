<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_1">The Apple New Product Process</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">In the months after the iMac launch, the A team also perfected a new methodology for developing products. Called the Apple new product process, or ANPP, it would emerge as one of the keys to Apple’s success.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Not surprisingly, in the world according to Steve Jobs, the ANPP would rapidly evolve into a well-defined process for bringing new products to market by laying out in extreme detail every stage of product development.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Embodied in a program that runs on the company’s internal network, the ANPP resembled a giant checklist. It detailed exactly what everyone was to do at every stage for every product, with instructions for every department ranging from hardware to software, and on to operations, finance, marketing, even the support teams that troubleshoot and repair the product after it goes to market. “It’s everything from the supply chain to the stores,” said one former executive. “It’s hooked into all the suppliers and the suppliers’ suppliers. Hundreds of companies. Everything from the paint and the screws to the chips.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber217"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber217" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The ANPP involves every department from the outset, including functions like marketing, whose work will only be seen after the product is launched. “It’s very important at Apple that the needs of the customer <a id="pageMap_142"></a>and needs to compete in the marketplace are considered when we create a product right from the beginning,” said Apple’s head of marketing Phil Schiller. “[M]arketing is an equal member of the team creating our products, along with the engineering and operations team.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber218"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber218" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Modeled in part on the best practices of HP and other Silicon Valley companies, the ANPP system, which Jobs had initiated at NeXT, was perfected in the early days of Jobs’s return to Apple. While such a procedure might seem to imply a hidebound approach, it was a worthy, pioneering move for Apple. One insider at the time described it this way: “It’s a very well-defined process, but it’s not onerous or bureaucratic. It allowed everyone to be more creative where it mattered, not less. Look at the results. Apple is a very fast company.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber219"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber219" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The system applied to Jony’s department, too, as the designers now had to tick off all of the steps, from investigation and concept to design and production. Sally Grisedale, former manager of Apple’s advanced technology group (which worked closely with the design group), said it was the systematic documentation that set Apple’s ANPP apart.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s all written down. It has to be. There are so many moving parts,” she said. “Even when I was there, all the processes were worked out. That’s why [Apple] was such a perfect company to work for, because they had booklets on how they do it, and they helped you, when building the software or the hardware. It had to be really systematic. So it was a very rude awakening for me to go a different company like Excite or Yahoo because they had none of that! Nothing written down. Like, Process? Are you kidding? Just ship it and get it out there!”<a id="SuperscriptNumber220"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber220" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another inspiration for the ANPP was the modern engineering management system known as “concurrent engineering,” which permits different departments to work in parallel (unlike the old model, under which projects get passed from one team to another in serial).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Big, complex engineering organizations like NASA and the European <a id="pageMap_143"></a>Space Agency were early proponents of concurrent engineering. It’s a complex but flexible methodology that tends to catch problems early, because it takes into account the entire production process and the full lifetime of the product, from manufacture to servicing and recycling. Jony has expressed admiration for the designers of space satellites, likely because of their use of concurrent engineering.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the old Apple, the engineers would work on a product before passing it to the designers to skin it. This wouldn’t work for Jobs’s new Apple, with the increased primacy of the ID studio.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The historical way of developing products just doesn’t work when you’re as ambitious as we are,” Jony has observed. “When the challenges are that complex, you have to develop a product in a more collaborative, integrated way.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber221"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber221" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
