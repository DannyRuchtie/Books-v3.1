			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">“We have something really exciting for you today,” said Steve Jobs on October, 23, 2001, at a special press event on Apple’s campus. Jobs had asked only a few dozen journalists to a product unveiling. The invite said simply, “Hint: It’s not a Mac.” Just a month after the September 11 attacks, and the world was still shell-shocked and, by Jobs’s showman standards, the event was low-key.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_185"></a>When Jobs first pulled the iPod from his jeans pocket, the reaction from the audience was muted. It didn’t seem that exciting, especially when the audience learned of its price: $499. Nearly $500 for an MP3 player—and one that worked only on the Mac, not Windows—seemed unrealistically high. Early reviewers were just as skeptical, with one saying that iPod stood for “Idiots Price Our Devices.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber264"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber264" class="calibre2">14</a></sup> The iPod sold only modestly at first and didn’t take off until two years later, when it was made fully compatible with Windows. Still, the seeds of the iPod’s success were sown with the first device and Jony was confident in the new product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Our goal was to design the very, very best MP3 player we could; to design something that could become an icon,” Jony said in the iPod’s first promotional video.<a id="SuperscriptNumber265"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber265" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Looking back on the process, Jobs believed the creation of the iPod was quintessential Apple. “If there was ever a product that catalyzed Apple’s reason for being, it’s this,” he said, “because it combines Apple’s incredible technology base with Apple’s legendary ease of use with Apple’s awesome design. Those three things come together in this, and it’s like, that’s what we do. So if anybody was ever wondering why Apple is on the earth, I would hold up this as a good example.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber266"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber266" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yet it was also an odd-duck project, led by engineering, not Jony’s design group as most of the products up to that time had been. Because of the rush to market, it was assembled from off-the-shelf parts and Jony was brought in to do a hated “skin job.” Yet he managed to put his mark on it by making it white, the color he’d championed for high-tech products since he was in college.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The project also earned him the nickname “Jony iPod,” and launched an armada of white tech products. The iPod would do for white what the iMac had done for translucent plastic. And Jony accomplished this tidal shift against the wishes of Steve Jobs, who had initially resisted white products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_186"></a>The iPod introduced numerous design features that would be used to dramatic effect in subsequent products, including Apple’s first touch interface (albeit a simple one). The iPod set the standard for many later products with its sealed case, compact design and radical ease of use—all Jony’s team’s work. It was also Apple’s first mobile product in the Jony/Jobs era; its development allowed Jony’s team to perfect the design and manufacture of portable products, thereby setting the standard for seamless cases and sealed batteries that eventually the whole industry adopted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPod stands as a remarkable accomplishment. U2’s Bono put its charm rather neatly when he said of the iPod, “It’s sexy.” Another adjective applies too: ubiquitous. The iPod’s appeal soon made the device a phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“[The iPod] was the first cultural icon of the 21st century,” said Dr. Michael Bull, a lecturer at the University of Sussex whose studies have earned him the nickname “Professor iPod.” “Roland Barthes argued that, in medieval society, cathedrals were the iconic form. Then, by the 1950s, it had become the car. . . . I argue that 50 years later, it was the iPod, this technology that let you fit your whole world into your pocket. It was representative of a key moment in the social world of the 21st century.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber267"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber267" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
