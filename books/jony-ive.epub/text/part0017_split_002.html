<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_2">Sir Jony Ive</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The year 2012 began auspiciously for Jony Ive, as it had for Apple, despite Jobs’s passing. Jony was named a Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen’s New Year Honours List, for services to design and enterprise. It was the second time he had been recognized in the honors list, having been made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005. The second highest order of chivalry, the KBE entitled its new bearer to style himself Sir Jonathan Ive.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony described the honor as “absolutely thrilling” and said he was “both humbled and sincerely grateful.” In a rare interview with the <em class="calibre3">Daily Telegraph</em>, he said he was “the product of a very British design education,” adding that, “even in high school, I was keenly aware of this remarkable tradition that the UK had of designing and making. It’s <a id="pageMap_257"></a>important to remember that Britain was the first country to industrialize, so I think there’s a strong argument to say this is where my profession was founded.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber357"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber357" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Phil Gray, Jony’s first boss at Robert Weavers Group, met up with Jony during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. “When I asked Sir Jony what was it like being a knight of the realm, he replied: ‘You know what? Out in San Francisco it means absolutely nothing. But back in Britain it is a burden.’”<a id="SuperscriptNumber358"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber358" class="calibre2">9</a></sup> Jony is referring to Britain’s strong class divisions. He’s no longer an everyman. He’s been elevated to a Knight of the Realm, and it embarrasses him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony used his visit to London to talk to some design students from Northumbria, his alma mater. He arranged for the temporary closure of an Apple store in London, inviting the students in for a private talk. “Jony likes to get his opinions across; there is no question about that,” said a source. “But it is also important to him to give students some support. I guess that is his way of giving something back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Northumbria’s most famous grad, Jony is regarded by his alma mater as a very valuable asset. Awarded the status of a visiting professor, he occasionally returns to give lectures. He features heavily in Northumbria’s marketing materials, but the college, protective of their special relationship, declined to talk about Jony or to release any information about his studies there.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He makes frequent visits to his homeland, staying in London three or four times a year. He has been seen at the London Fashion Week and attends the annual Goodwood Festival of Speed, a race meet for fans of fast, exotic cars. He’s served as a judge at Goodwood, where he’s been photographed with fellow designer Marc Newsom and composer Nick Wood, two of his best friends. The three often attend one another’s functions. Jony is also friends with Paul Smith, the British clothes designer, whom he presented with a giant pink iPod nano for his birthday.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_258"></a>Though design is sometimes thought of as a lonely, isolating process, Jony travels the world regularly. Although he will sometimes spend weeks with suppliers in Asia, on most trips, he’s in and out quickly. In 2013, he traveled to Amsterdam for a day, during which he went aboard Steve Jobs’s boat (designed by Philippe Starck and custom-built in Holland) and opened the new Apple store there.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In 2012, Jony and his wife and twin sons upgraded to a new San Francisco home, purchasing a seventeen-million-dollar spread on San Francisco’s “Gold Coast,” also known as Billionaire Row. Despite his image as a soft-spoken everyman in jeans and T-shirt, he’s often photographed at exclusive venues with other well-suited high rollers. When at home in San Francisco, he’s been known to attend the symphony and he socializes with the Silicon Valley elite. He’s been photographed at celebrity dinners with valley bigwigs such as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and the CEOs of Yelp, Dropbox and Path.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Occasionally, Jony gets involved in side projects. He designed some striking Soundstick speakers for Harman Kardon, which are part of the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection. In 2012, he designed on commission a one-shot camera for Leica, which was to be auctioned for charity. Jony and Jobs were both fans of the storied camera maker, and when announcing the iPhone 4, Jobs compared it to “a beautiful old Leica camera.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber359"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber359" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By all appearances, Jony remains committed to Apple, despite occasional rumors to the contrary. He’s also reportedly working on a monograph of his work at Apple.</p>
