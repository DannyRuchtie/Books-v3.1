			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The day before Steve Jobs died, Cook debuted the iPhone 4s at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. There was an empty seat for Jobs marked “Reserved”; Jony was notably absent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iPhone 4s was Jony’s third-generation design, based on Richard <a id="pageMap_256"></a>Howarth’s early Sandwich concepts, and the device was the most advanced iPhone yet. Though it shared the same physical appearance as its predecessor, the iPhone 4, it had much-improved guts, and was a marvel of engineering. When the new iPhone went on sale on October 14, some critics called it overhyped and more of the same, but to judge from sales, the public disagreed. The first weekend saw a record-breaking debut, with four million units sold, and the iPhone 4s quickly become the world’s best-selling smartphone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The importance of Apple’s first successful post-Jobs product launch did not go unnoticed on Wall Street. Apple’s stock began to soar. A share of Apple’s stock sold for $407.61 on January 3, 2012, reflecting a balance sheet that contained over $100 billion in cash, a sum that grew by the day. By the end of January, a single share of Apple cost $447.61.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple was riding high, having surpassed ExxonMobil as the most valuable publicly held company in the world.</p>
