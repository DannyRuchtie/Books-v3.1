			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The unibody process is revolutionizing high-tech manufacturing. At Apple, the move toward robot workflow has, in a sense, revived Steve <a id="pageMap_246"></a>Jobs’s long-cherished dream once manifested in his 1980s Macintosh factory in the Bay Area with its automated production line. Machining used to be used strictly for prototyping, and no one employed it on an industrial scale until Jony came along. But others have been quick to recognize its importance. Dennis Boyle, one of the cofounders of IDEO, said machining products on an industrial scale is “a dream for product designers.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber344"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber344" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Companies have always traditionally avoided machining because it costs more than other techniques,” he said, “but Apple has figured out a way. . . . Apple has proved that if a company invests at the highest level and takes Ive and his team’s designs and really sticks to them without compromising on how they look and feel, then it can create products that are so sought after, so beautiful and elegant, that they can make them a success. From a design and engineering point of view, Apple is at the absolute pinnacle of creating products that are as close to flawless as can be done.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Unibody represents a giant financial gamble by Apple. When it started investing seriously around 2007, Apple contracted with a Japanese manufacturer to buy all the milling machines it could produce for the next three years. By one estimate, that was 20,000 CNC milling machines a year, some costing upward of $250,000 and others $1 million or more. The spending didn’t stop there, as Apple bought up even more, acquiring every CNC milling machine the company could find. “They bought up the entire supply,” said one source. “No one else could get a look in.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber345"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber345" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This spending on tooling ramped up with the iPhone and iPad, which relied more on machining with each generation. According to Horace Dediu of Asymco, an analyst firm, the original iPhone cost $408 million in equipment investment. But by 2012, as the iPhone 5 <a id="pageMap_247"></a>and iPad 3 (both unibody products) went to production, Apple’s capital expenditures ballooned to even more mind-boggling levels. Apple spent $9.5 billion on capital expenditures, the majority of which was earmarked for product tooling and manufacturing processes. By comparison, the company spent $865 million on retail stores. Thus, Apple spent nearly eleven times as much on its factories as on its stores, most of which are in prime (that is, expensive) real estate locations.<a id="SuperscriptNumber346"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber346" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another manufacturing innovation made necessary by Jony’s design desires—in this case, to get razor-thin edges on the 2012 iMacs—is friction welding. Given the thin profile of the iMac, traditional welding methods couldn’t be used to join the front and the back. Enter the need for so-called friction stir welding (FSW), a solid-state welding process invented in 1991. It’s actually less of a weld than a recrystallization, as the atoms of the two pieces are joined in a super strong bond when a high-speed bobbin is moved along the edges to be bonded, creating friction and softening the material almost to its melting point. The plasticized materials are then pushed together under enormous force, and the spinning bobbin stirs them together. The result is a seamless and very strong bond.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the past, FSW required machines costing up to three million dollars apiece, so its use was confined to fabricating rocket and airplane parts. More recent advances allowed CNC milling machines to be retrofitted to perform FSW at a much lower cost. That opened the door for Apple, which has many CNC machines at its disposal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In addition to its other advantages, FSW produces no toxic fumes and finished pieces that require no extra filler metal for further machining, making the process more environmentally friendly than traditional welding.</p>
