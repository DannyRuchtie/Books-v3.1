			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title">Manufacturing, Materials and Other Matters</h1>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">One of the great things about our team, about working so closely together is the feeling that we’re really only at the beginning of something, that we have only just started. We still have lots more to do.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—JONY IVE</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Over the years, the genius of Jony Ive’s IDg studio has been most apparent when the team confronted special challenges. A blending of epiphany thinking and practical implementation became a signal characteristic of the Jobs-and-Jony collaboration. More often than not, the original solutions the team came up with pushed the boundaries of traditional manufacturing; the refining of the design of the original iMac is a case in point.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">About eighteen months after the first iMac hit the market, Jony’s team starting to think about replacing its bulky CRT with a light, thin LCD screen. The team began work in 2000, and the project proved challenging, requiring scores of prototypes. But the finished product would be one of Apple’s most distinctive computers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At first, Jony’s team came up with a conventional concept for a flat-screen computer, with the guts of the computer attached to the back, much like the earlier Twentieth Anniversary Mac Jony had designed. But Steve Jobs disliked what he saw as ugly and inelegant.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_188"></a>“Why have this flat display if you’re going to glom all this stuff on its back?” he asked Jony. “We should let each element be true to itself.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber268"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber268" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">According to Walter Isaacson’s biography, Jobs left Apple HQ early to think it over at his home in Palo Alto. Jony dropped by and they took a walk in Jobs’s garden, which Jobs’s wife, Laurene, had planted with sunflowers. Jony and Steve were riffing on their design problem, when Jony wondered what the iMac might look like if the screen was separated from the other components like a sunflower on its stalk.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony became excited and started sketching ideas. “Ive liked his designs to suggest a narrative,” wrote Isaacson, “and he realized that a sunflower shape would convey that the flat screen was so fluid and responsive that it could reach for the sun.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber269"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber269" class="calibre2">2</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A former executive tells the story differently. Jony made two prototypes. One was the ugly, inelegant flat-screen unit, the other a “goose neck” design with a separate screen and base. At the presentation, Jobs chose the gooseneck design because it was “anthropomorphic.” Like the original Mac, Jobs wanted a “friendly” computer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s team next faced the problem of attaching the screen to the base.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">First they tried a series of ball-and-socket pieces that resembled the vertebrae of a spine. The vertebrae were held together by a system of spring-loaded cables with a clamp attached to the back of the screen. When the clamp was tight, it tensioned the cables and held the vertebrae in place. When the clamp was loosened, it put slack on the cables and allowed the spine to be moved. “The display floated so that you had to grab it with two hands to release the lock, and then when you positioned it, it locked in place. It had a series of these beautiful balls and sockets, and the power and signal cables went through the neck,” said Satzger. “When you released everything it would relax, and when you tightened it, it would lock with a big cam mechanism.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_189"></a>The team made scores of prototypes, which might have looked beautiful, but they turned out to be impractical. Locking and unlocking the spine clamp took two hands, making it difficult for some users, especially children, to adjust the monitor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Temporarily stumped, Jony asked the design consultancy IDEO to come in and take a look. IDEO was supposed to evaluate the usefulness of the design, but instead their designers suggested replacing the spine with two rigid arms that resembled an anglepoise lamp. That seemed like a great idea, and much more practical.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s group made several more prototypes and found that IDEO’s two-segment arm worked well. But Satzger wondered aloud in one of the brainstorming sessions, “Why do we need that much flexibility? Why don’t we adopt a one-arm mechanism?” Satzger’s suggestion led nowhere—until Jony and Steve returned to the IDg studio after a meeting. Steve also suggested dropping the second arm.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Again, Jony’s team set to work. After a lot of engineering, the arm they came up with was of stainless steel that, thanks to an internal spring under very high pressure, balanced the weight of the screen perfectly. The screen could be moved easily with just one finger; its cables ran internally.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We were all really excited about it,” Satzger said. “We loved it. We learned a ton of things too doing it.” Jony summed up their accomplishment, calling it “an engineering tour de force. That was an extremely difficult problem to solve. . . . [The arm] seems simple, but that simplicity belies something very complex.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber270"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber270" class="calibre2">3</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jony’s team also agonized over the bezel, the plastic frame around the display. The earliest prototypes had a very narrow bezel but the designers found that, when adjusting the display, it was almost impossible not to poke the screen, producing that rippling effect that reminds you what <a id="pageMap_190"></a>the “L” in LCD stands for (liquid crystal display). When they tried a thicker bezel, Jony thought it “took away from the story of this amazingly bright, light display.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber271"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber271" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That led to the idea of a “halo,” a wide rim of transparent plastic that would give users something to grab without ruining the aesthetics of the screen. The halo was used to great effect in the iPod, and became one of the most recognizable design motifs of Jony’s clear-on-white era, one that would carry through to the bezel of the present iPad.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The dome base of the iMac was another feat of engineering. The iMac G4 crammed a computer, drives, and a power supply into its hemispherical base. It had a cooling system borrowed from the Cube, which sucked air in through the bottom and expelled it out of the top, but, unlike the Cube, the chips ran hot, requiring a fan. Even so, Jony remembered, “There’s not a screw or detail that’s not there for a very good reason.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber272"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber272" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">According to Jony, the design of the iMac G4 was ingenious not because of its shape but its unexpected unobtrusiveness. Although it looked like a freaky lamp on approach, everything but the screen disappeared when the user sat in front of it. “With the new iMac, if you just sit there for ten minutes and move the display around, you quickly forget about its design. The design gets out of the way,” Jony concluded. “We are not interested in design statements. We do everything we can to simplify design.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber273"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber273" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As with the marketing of the iPod, Jony’s team also designed the iMac’s packaging. Boxes may seem trivial, but Jony’s team felt that unpacking a product greatly influenced the all-important first impressions. “Steve and I spend a lot of time on the packaging,” Jony said then. “I love the process of unpacking something. You design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special. Packaging can be theater, it can create a story.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber274"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber274" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Though they took the process seriously, that didn’t mean they lacked <a id="pageMap_191"></a>a sense of humor. As a joke, the design team designed the inside of the iMac G4’s box to look like male genitals. “You had the neck laying there and the two ball speakers next to it,” said Satzger. “People would open the box and say ‘What?’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Steve Jobs unveiled the iMac G4 at Macworld in January 2002, <em class="calibre3">Time</em> magazine featured it on the cover that week, just the second time a product launch had made the magazine’s cover.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This is the best thing I think we’ve ever done,” Jobs said on stage as he introduced the machine. “It has a rare beauty and grace that is going to last the next decade.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he showed a picture of the base, he said, “Isn’t that the most beautiful bottom of a computer you’ve ever seen?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony appeared in a promotional video that Jobs showed to the crowd. “The easy part was knowing we were going to use a flat panel display,” Jony said to the camera.<a id="SuperscriptNumber275"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber275" class="calibre2">8</a></sup> “The hard part was how. Our solution appears to defy gravity. It’s just this very simple, pure frame that appears to float in space. When you look at it now, it seems so simple, it seems so obvious, and yet again, the simplest, most efficient solution has been the most elusive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Following Jobs’s keynote, Jony quietly walked the MacWorld show floor, trying to gauge people’s reactions. He’d worked on the various pieces of the iMac in secret for two years, and, with no public feedback, Jony worried that the marketplace might not like the imaginative new machine. “I think they like it,” he concluded later. “Yeah, yeah, people are . . . pretty enthusiastic.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber276"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber276" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He needn’t have worried. The iMac G4 helped reset Apple’s public image, which had suffered after the failure of the Cube. With Jony at the design helm Apple was at the top of the game again, with Jony helping set its course.</p>
