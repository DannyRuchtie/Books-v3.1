			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jony’s role at Apple evolved, as he became more managerial than design driven. Jony both ran the group and recruited new members. He was the conduit of information between the design group and the rest of the company, especially at the executive level. He worked very closely with Steve Jobs when he was alive—and now with Apple’s executives—to <a id="pageMap_170"></a>select what products to work on and what directions they should take. Nothing is done without his input, whether it’s the color of a product or the detail of a button. “Everything is reviewed by Jony,” said one of the designers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">According to Rubinstein, “Jony is a good leader. He is a brilliant designer, and his team respects him. Jony has very good product sense.” Satzger shared this assessment.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jony is very effective as a leader,” Satzger reported. “He is a soft-spoken English gentlemen who had Jobs’s ear.” It was clear in the past that, in many ways, Jony was the hand implementing Jobs’s vision. If Jobs didn’t like something, he’d say so, but that was the only direction he gave. His feedback was always non-directive. He never suggested how something should be changed but rather pushed Jony and his designers to come up with a better solution.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As their relationship grew, Jony was also known to manage up. “A lot of times, it was Jony who would drive Steve,” said Satzger. “He might say to Steve, ‘I think we should change this,’ if he felt that it was important to do something different.” Nor was Jony afraid to go around his executive colleagues to Jobs directly if someone battled or challenged him or his team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony is very protective of his design team, especially in context of the other departments at Apple. “He’ll take the blame personally for screw ups,” said Gautam Baksi. “He’d fall on the sword for the weakest part of the design. If it’s something not up to snuff, he’d personally say it was his fault. I never felt like he threw any of the other ID members under the bus.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although the ID team was close-knit, this collegiality did not necessarily extend to other people at Apple. A former engineer in the product design group, who worked with IDg for almost a decade, said interactions with Jony and his team were formal and strained, and he was constantly reminded of the primacy of the design group at Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_171"></a>“I only spoke when I was spoken to,” said the engineer Baksi. “These guys get paid a lot more than me and could make my life hell. I went in [the ID studio] with a purpose and left immediately afterwards. I never spent any extra time in there. I didn’t socialize with the ID guys.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s designers, however, often socialize together after work, especially those living in San Francisco. For many of the designers, social life and work are one. At Macworld, they often got a limo—sometimes full of Bollinger champagne—and headed out to dinner and for drinks afterward. A former product design engineer remembers being at a black-tie event at the Clift San Francisco Hotel. “Around midnight in rolls the ID crew for the after-party that is going on in the hotel lobby,” the engineer said. “Stringer, Ive, Whang and a bunch more were there. . . . They’re always very trendy, into trendy music.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Many of Jony’s team have kids. Even though the design studio is off-limits to outsiders, the designers frequently bring their youngsters in. Satzger, for one, brought his children into the studio all the time. His daughter, who was interested in pursuing a design career, wrote a college essay about growing up in the Apple ID studio, about process and how things were built and why. “She was part of the group; she could be found there for eight to ten hours,” said Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was the exception as he kept his wife and twin sons, Charlie and Harry, removed from the bustle of the Apple campus. Some of the designers who live in San Francisco know his family, but to the others they are a mystery. It’s an odd paradox for a man whose father had such a strong influence on his son’s interest in design.</p>
