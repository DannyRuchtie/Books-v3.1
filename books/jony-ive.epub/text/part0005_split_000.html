			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">Its hydraulics were so well put together, that it folded out almost with a sigh. I could see the incipient talent that was coming out of Jonathan.</p>

			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">According to legend, Chingford is the birthplace of sirloin steak. After a banquet at a local manor house late in the seventeenth century, King Charles II took such delight in his meal that he is said to have knighted a large hunk of meat Sir Loin.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another product of Chingford, Jonathan Paul Ive, entered the world much later, on February 27, 1967.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Like its latter-day son, Chingford is quiet and unassuming. A well-to-do bedroom community on the northeast edge of London, the borough borders the rural county of Essex, just south of Epping Forest. Chingford votes Conservative, as the constituency of Iain Duncan Smith, former leader of the Conservative Party, who holds a seat famously occupied by Sir Winston Churchill.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony Ive’s childhood circumstances were comfortable but modest. His father, Michael John Ive, was a silversmith, his mother, Pamela Mary Ive, a psychotherapist. They had a second child, daughter Alison, two years after their son’s birth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony attended Chingford Foundation School, later to be the alma mater of David Beckham, the famous soccer star (Beckham attended eight years after Jony). While at school, Jony was diagnosed with the <a id="pageMap_2"></a>learning disability dyslexia (a condition he shared with a fellow left-brained colleague, Steve Jobs).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As a young boy, Jony exhibited a curiosity about the workings of things. He became fascinated by how objects were put together, carefully dismantling radios and cassette recorders, intrigued with how they were assembled, how the pieces fit. Though he tried to put the equipment back together again, he didn’t always succeed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I remember always being interested in made objects,” he recalled in a 2003 interview conducted at London’s Design Museum. “As a kid, I remember taking apart whatever I could get my hands on. Later, this developed into more of an interest in how they were made, how they worked, their form and material.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber0"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber0" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Mike Ive encouraged his son’s interest, constantly engaging the youngster in conversations about design. Although Jony didn’t always see the larger context implied by his playthings (“The fact they had been designed was not obvious or even interesting to me initially,” he told the London crowd in 2003), his father nurtured an engagement with design throughout Jony’s childhood.</p>
