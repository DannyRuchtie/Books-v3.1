<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_4">Offshore</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">For better and for worse, Apple has become the poster child for the ills of offshore manufacturing. Foxconn assembly plants in particular have attracted criticism; after a rash of worker suicides in 2009, negative international attention resulted in investigations that exposed a host of labor abuses.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_209"></a>Foxconn had as many as half a million workers in some of its plants, assembling iPhones and iPads by hand. The workers, mostly young, lived in dormitories, ate in shifts in gigantic communal canteens and often worked eighty- to one-hundred-hour weeks. Apple had its Nike moment, becoming the focus of anger about digital sweatshops and worker exploitation, even though Foxconn’s factories make products for almost all the major electronics firms, not just Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Long before the controversy, however, Apple helped change the game in manufacturing, forging close relationships with Chinese manufacturers, constantly pushing the limits of what their factories are capable of doing. But the process involved a certain amount of bemusement as to the ways of the Asian companies.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger for one was both impressed by Foxconn and amused at how they did things. “There was a lot of politics,” he said. “They would stage things for us. Lots of theatrics. They would bring managers into meetings and yell at them in front of the Apple group.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On one occasion, the Apple group was carefully positioned outside of a conference room with big glass windows. Inside, a Foxconn executive was yelling at his staff. As the Apple group looked on, he brought his fist down on the glass conference table and shattered it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He completely set that up,” said Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Foxconn has a mixed reputation, but Satzger said all the engineers—everyone who dealt with Apple at a higher level—were really happy and engaged. However, the assembly plants have been the critical lightning rod, as thousands of workers perform repetitive tasks assembling the products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The designers spent a lot of time flying out to China to work with Foxconn and other contractors. Satzger would never spend more than five days at a time there. If need be, he’d fly back to California for the weekend, then fly out again the following week. Jony, on the other hand, <a id="pageMap_210"></a>would sometimes be gone for weeks, and some of the other designers for months.<a id="x.1080"></a> Of course, they were pioneering new materials and new means of manufacture for Apple’s extraordinary products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the years, the elevated status of Jony’s group would be reflected in their accommodations. According to a former operations engineer, “When all of the teams went to China, the PD [product design] guys and the ID guys, we usually all worked together in the factory. But when we left, the ID guys got picked up in stretch limos and we had to take a taxi,” the source said. “All the ID guys stayed in 5-star hotels while most of the PD guys stayed in 3-star hotels. This was different from 10 to 15 years earlier, when in the middle of the build-up to make the iMac, all the designers, including Jony and Danny Coster, lived and ate in the same hotels as the engineers and the rest of the Apple crew.”</p>
