<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_2">The “A” Team</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jobs’s plan for switching up the teams at Apple upon his return was just as straightforward as his notions for simplifying the product portfolio. <a id="pageMap_111"></a>He would cut back so that his “A” team—the company’s best designers, engineers, programmers and marketers—could concentrate on making innovative products.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs already trusted his old NeXT executives, but he looked to spot existing Apple talent and elevate them in the ranks. The people survey he conducted led to a streamlining of Apple’s organizational chart. Jobs insisted on a clear chain of command all the way down the line. Everyone in the company knew to whom they reported and what was expected of them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Jobs told <em class="calibre3">BusinessWeek</em>, “Everything just got simpler. That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber162"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber162" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">During the process of his product and personnel reviews, Jobs called a meeting with half a dozen top analysts and journalists covering Apple. He wanted to explain to them his new game plan.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He specifically emphasized getting back to meeting the needs of their core customers and said that Apple had lost ground in the market because they were trying to be everything to everybody instead of focusing on the real needs of their customers,” said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, who was in the room. “He also pointed out that Apple had broken new ground with the original Mac OS and hardware designs and that he would now make industrial design a key part of Apple’s strategy going forward.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber163"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber163" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Bajarin, for one, was skeptical.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“My first impression was that Apple had so many problems that I could not see how industrial design needed to be a key part of his strategy to save Apple,” Bajarin recalled. “I also was concerned that given Apple’s serious financial situation, whatever he was going to do needed to be rock solid and have an impact quickly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Bajarin had another recollection: “I also remember telling the people I was with that you can never underestimate Steve Jobs and that if anybody can save Apple, it would be Jobs.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber164"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber164" class="calibre2">14</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_112"></a>Despite his talk about returning Apple to a design-led company, Jobs didn’t immediately visit the ID studio. Brunner’s strategy of putting the studio off campus almost backfired, because, unaware of what he already had, Jobs went to look for a world-class designer from outside the company.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He thought seriously about bringing back his old design partner, Hartmut Esslinger of Frog Design, who had been working with NeXT. He called on Richard Sapper, who did the IBM ThinkPad laptop, and, incredibly, the car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro, whose run with Apple a few years before had produced nothing. Jobs also considered the famous Italian architect and designer Ettore Sotsass, who had catapulted Olivetti to the forefront of ID in the sixties.<a id="SuperscriptNumber165"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber165" class="calibre2">15</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Across the road, Jony Ive realized his team was in jeopardy and that he had to demonstrate to his new boss what his shop could do. He put together brochures showcasing their best design work. He included in the glossy pamphlets concepts for evolving Apple’s design language, which, with the translucent eMate, had just started moving in a bold new direction. “We generated small booklets to represent the team’s capabilities,” said a former designer on the team. “I think that played a great role in how Steve Jobs coming back perceived the team and its capabilities.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Jobs finally took a tour of Apple’s design studio, he was bowled over by the creativity and rigor he saw. The studio was full of eye-catching mock-ups that the previous regime had been too timid to consider. Jobs also couldn’t help but notice the computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines and a fledgling computer-aided design (CAD) group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Mostly, though, he bonded with the soft-spoken Jony, who would later say that he and Jobs saw eye to eye immediately. “We discussed approaches to forms and materials,” Jony recalled. “We were on the same wavelength. I suddenly understood why I loved the company.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_113"></a>Jobs decided to keep the ID group intact, with Jony in charge. He initially made Jony report to Jon Rubinstein, head of hardware. (Eventually that would change, when design became its own autonomous division.) Even though Jony reported to Rubinstein, over the next few months Jony and Jobs began having lunch together. Jobs visited the Valley Green design studio too, often dropping by at the end of the day.<a id="SuperscriptNumber166"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber166" class="calibre2">16</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He would come over all the time,” said a former member of the design team. “He’d come mostly to see Jony, but also to see what was going on.” In time, Jobs become almost a fixture there.</p>
