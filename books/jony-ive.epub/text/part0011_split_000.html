			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title">The Design Studio Behind the Iron Curtain</h1>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph">When Steve came in, he wanted the conversation to be between him and the person he was talking to. . . . [W]e would turn the music up so that his voice would carry directly to one person only. You really couldn’t hear what he was saying.</p>
			<p class="x03-Chapter-Epigraph-Source">—DOUG SATZGER</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">On February 9, 2001, after the hubbub of Macworld Expo had died down, the industrial design studio moved from the building on Valley Green Drive (across the road from Apple’s main campus) to a large space inside Apple’s HQ, where it remains today. The new design studio was put on the ground floor of Infinite Loop 2, known internally at Apple as IL2.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The move was, in part, symbolic. Bob Brunner had set up the original studio across the street to give it some independence from the rest of the company. Now ID would inhabit space at the heart of Apple, allowing Jobs to work more closely with Jony and his team. It affirmed for all to see the elevated status of design within the company. In Jony’s words, ID was now truly “close to the heartbeat of the company.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber241"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber241" class="calibre2">1</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The move was a big one logistically, too, since the studio had become home to big machinery and prototyping equipment. The new quarters were carefully crafted for Jony’s designers, with every piece of furniture—the tables, the chairs and even the glass—made to order.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_160"></a>A large space, the studio occupies most of the ground floor of IL2. Security is extremely tight, and a wall of large frosted windows across the bottom of the building prevents anyone from getting a peek inside.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Inside, the studio is divided into several different spaces. To the left of the entrance is a well-equipped kitchen with a large table where Jony’s team conducts their biweekly brainstorming sessions. To the right of the studio’s front entrance is a small, rarely used conference room.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Opposite the front entrance is Jony’s office. A glass cube measuring about twelve feet by twelve feet, it’s the only private office in the studio. The front wall and door are made of glass with stainless steel fittings, just like the ones in Apple’s stores. Except for a small shelf system, Jony’s office is bare with plain white walls, featuring no pictures of his family or design awards, just a desk, chair and lamp.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His leather chair is a Supporto chair from the UK office furniture manufacturer Hille. Designed in 1979 by the award-winning designer Fred Scott, the leather and aluminum chair is recognized as a design masterpiece. Jony himself cited it as one of his favorite designs (“the Supporto is a wonderful chair,” Jony told <em class="calibre3">ICON</em> magazine),<a id="SuperscriptNumber242"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber242" class="calibre2">2</a></sup> and he selected it for the new Industrial Design Centre in Cupertino, California, and for his designers, all of whom sit at Supporto desks with leather chairs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s desk was custom-made by London-based designer Marc Newsom, one of his best friends. The desk is usually bare except for his seventeen-inch MacBook and several colored pencils used for drawing, which are typically arranged neatly on his desk. He doesn’t use an external monitor or other peripheral equipment.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Directly outside Jony’s office are four large wooden project tables that are used to present prototype products to executives. This was where Steve Jobs gravitated when he visited the studio. In fact, the studio setup gave Jobs the idea for the big open tables in the Apple stores. Each table <a id="pageMap_161"></a>is dedicated to a different project—one for MacBooks, another for the iPad, the iPhone and so on. They are used to display models and prototypes of whatever Jony has to show Jobs and other executives. The models are covered at all times with black cloth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Next to Jony’s office and the presentation tables is a large CAD room, also fronted by a glass wall. The CAD room is home to about fifteen CAD operators (“surface guys”). If the designers want to see what a CAD model looks like as a real object, they’ll send the file to a CNC milling machine in the machine shop next door.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The machine room, aka “the shop,” is at the far end of the space. The shop is divided internally into three rooms by more glass walls. At the front are three big CNC machines. These big hulking milling machines are capable of crafting anything from metal to RenShape. They have covers that contain scrap materials, making them “clean” machines. Behind them are the “dirty” machines, namely, various cutting and drilling machines that can create a mess. The so-called dirty shop is sealed behind glass. Next to it, on the right, is a finishing room with fine-sanding machines and a big paint-spraying booth about the size of a car.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The shop is used by the design team to make models of upcoming products to quickly validate ideas. “They’d get a CAD file for surfacing; they would create a tool path based on the surfaces, do all the setups and run a part,” said Satzger. As well as modeling the basic shape of a product, the team will make models of details: the corner of a product or its buttons, for example. Often, Jony’s team makes hundreds of models, just like Jony did in college. As the product development process progresses, the design team will outsource model making to an outside specialist firm.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s office, the presentation tables, the CAD room and shop are all to the right of the front entrance. On the other side, an opening near <a id="pageMap_162"></a>Jony’s office leads to the area where the designers work. In the large open space, lined by the long wall of frosted windows, the designers work at five large tables, subdivided by low dividers. The space is messy and chaotic, with boxes, parts, samples, bikes and toys everywhere. The atmosphere feels light, fun. “Someone might be skateboarding in there, doing jumps, or Bart Andre and Chris Stringer kicking a soccer ball,” said Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Music is an important part of the design studio’s atmosphere. There are about twenty white speakers in the room, with a pair of thirty-six-inch-high concert subwoofers. “When you walked into this concrete and steel, highly reflective room, the sound was immediately deep and loud,” Satzger remembered. “All kinds of music from around the world is played. It’s really lively. We had so much music on that thing, you could pick anything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony is a big fan of techno—music that drove Jony’s boss, Jon Rubinstein, to distraction. “They played loud techno-pop in the design studio,” he said. “I like quiet so that I can focus and think properly. But the ID guys liked it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The energy of that room, the noise of the room made me work a lot better,” said Satzger. “I hated sitting back in my little space. . . . [F]or me, the louder the noise the better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Steve Jobs liked the music too, and often turned up the music when he visited, but for more than its sonic pleasures. “When Steve came in, he wanted the conversation to be between him and the person he was talking to,” said Satzger. “In all these open spaces, if it’s quiet, it’s really easy to hear what people are talking about. When he came in, we would turn the music up so that his voice would carry directly to one person only. You really couldn’t hear what he was saying.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The studio seemed to have a visible effect on the intense Jobs. “Steve in the ID space was a different person. He was a lot more relaxed and <a id="pageMap_163"></a>interactive,” Satzger said. “Steve had moods all the time. There were always things that were changing in how he approached people. But when he came in the ID space, he was always really comfortable.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs spent a lot of time in the studio, but when he was away, Jony used his absence as an opportunity to get work done for the absent master. “When he went away, we would do 150 to 200 percent more work,” Satzger explained. “It was a good chance to blast stuff out and put new work, new ideas in front of him when he came back.”</p>
