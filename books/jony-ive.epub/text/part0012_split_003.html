			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">“From early on we wanted something that would seem so natural and so inevitable and so simple you almost wouldn’t think of it as having been designed,” Jony explained. The shape wasn’t the issue—“it could have been shaped like a banana if we’d wanted.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber254"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber254" class="calibre2">4</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Given the parts of the device (the screen, the chip, the battery), the elements sandwiched naturally together into a box. “Sometimes things are really clear from the materials they are made from, and this was one of those times,” said Rubinstein. “It was obvious how it was going to look when it was put together.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber255"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber255" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony named Richard Howarth the lead designer, and they used Fadell’s chunk of Foam Core as a reference. The big challenge was to design the user interface. Locating the screen was an issue, and so was whether or not to use buttons. The method of selecting songs was critical. The process inevitably reduced and reduced, resulting in a device with four buttons mounted on a dial.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs worked on the interface with Tim Wasko, a veteran user interface (UI) designer who’d been at NeXT. Wasko was also working with Robbin on the UI for iTunes. He’d previously impressed Jobs with the metallic interface he created for QuickTime 4, which Jobs eventually adopted in most of Apple’s software, so he was given the job of figuring out the UI for the iPod.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He started by mapping out all the options a user would face when selecting a song: the artists, their albums and finally all the songs on a particular album. “When I diagrammed it out it was a series of lists connected to each other,” he said. “It was a question of pressing a button to go down to the next list, and pressing another button to come back up.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber256"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber256" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wasko created a demo in Adobe Director, a multimedia authoring <a id="pageMap_180"></a>program, that was pretty simple and straightforward. Before he showed it to Jobs, he replaced the original cursor keys from a keyboard with a USB jog wheel for editing video. The jog wheel had a central dial for scrubbing through video, and several buttons above and below it. Wasko drew paper labels for the four buttons on the bottom (play/pause, backward, forward and menu) and ignored the buttons on top. It worked great. Jobs was delighted with the system but pushed Wasko to get rid of the fourth button. Wasko should have known better. “If you give Steve one thing, he’s going to hate it, even if it’s great,” remembered Wasko. “So you have to make some other crap to put on the table.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wasko had brought nothing to sacrifice, and so he tried to find a way to get rid of one of the buttons. He labored for weeks but he just couldn’t find a way to navigate the hierarchy with just three buttons. “We worked our butts off on that thing,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs finally acquiesced to the extra button, and Wasko took his Mac and jog wheel over to show Jony at the ID studio. “It was a quick meeting,” Wasko said. “They already knew it was going to be a wheel. I just showed Jony how the interface worked.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony started experimenting with different places to put the screen and scroll wheel, but the options were limited. His team initially wanted to put four buttons above the wheel, just below the screen, but then decided to put the buttons around the scroll wheel instead. This made them easy to press with a thumb while turning the wheel.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Steve Jobs made some very interesting observations very early on about how this was about navigating content,” Jony would tell the <em class="calibre3">New York Times</em>. “It was about being very focused and not trying to do too much with the device—which would have been its complication and, therefore, its demise. The enabling features aren’t obvious and evident, because the key was getting rid of stuff.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber257"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber257" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To the consternation of a lot of users and reviewers, at least at first, <a id="pageMap_181"></a>an on-off button was omitted. The idea of pressing any button to turn the device on—and then to have it turn itself off after a period of inactivity—was a stroke of minimalist genius.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“As such a radically new product, the iPod was inherently so compelling that it seemed appropriate for the design effort to be to simplify, remove and reduce,” Jony said.<a id="SuperscriptNumber258"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber258" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Other standard features of portable consumer electronics disappeared too, among them the battery compartment. Most gadgets had removable batteries, meaning they need a battery door, plus an internal wall to seal the device’s guts from the user when the battery door is opened. Jony dispensed with both. A tighter, smaller product resulted, and Apple’s research had already shown that no one changed their batteries anyway, even if they said they did. The sealed battery would cause an outcry, of course, because users (and reviewers especially) had come to expect a replaceable battery as a standard feature. But dispensing with it allowed the iPod’s case to be just two pieces, comprising a stainless steel back, called the “canoe,” which snapped into an acrylic face via an internal latching mechanism. Fewer parts also meant fewer “tolerances” (gaps) in manufacturing the product (when adjacent components are supposed to be flush, the design must allow for a tolerance; with fewer parts, alignment issues diminish).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony would use the same basic schema for subsequent sealed products, including several generations of iPods, the iPhone, iPad and MacBooks. “They are basically a screen and a back cover—just two parts,” said Satzger. “It’s a better product. A much better product.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The stainless steel back turned out to be a contentious choice: It looked great right out of the box, but was easily scratched and dented. Even if it wasn’t the most obvious choice of material, the stainless steel worked, according to design consultant Chris Lefteri. “It is actually a completely irrational use of that material in that context,” he said, <a id="pageMap_182"></a>noting that most other companies would have picked more durable plastic. “To put stainless steel on the back of a portable music player makes no logical sense, because it scratches easily, it dents, it is very heavy—but it absolutely worked.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber259"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber259" class="calibre2">9</a></sup> One Apple executive said Jony’s group chose steel simply because it was the thinnest, strongest material they could quickly work with.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apart from the back, the iPod was “beautifully made,” Lefteri said, demonstrating the design team’s mastery of plastic production techniques at that point. Each iPod case was hand polished, as were the weld lines inside. “Apple did not so much use new materials,” Lefteri explained, “but rather pushed the possibilities of existing ones. . . . That is Apple being very demanding of the materials, very obsessive about the levels of finish.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The white color of the iPod was Jony’s idea. Jony regarded Apple’s Kubrickian white stage as a reaction to the crazy color stage, which itself was a reaction to beige. “Right from the very first time, we were thinking about the product, we’d seen [the iPod] as stainless steel and white,” he said. “It’s just so . . . so brutally simple. It’s not just a color. Supposedly neutral—but just an unmistakable, shocking neutral.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber260"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber260" class="calibre2">10</a></sup> White also sent a message that the machine wouldn’t dominate the user, unlike black tech products that tended to come off as “technical” or “nerdy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shockingly neutral white” became the new normal for all of Apple’s consumer products at the time. The new iMac and iBooks, as yet unreleased, were also fashioned in white plastic. “There was a whole new design language going through the shop,” said the former executive. Product designer Satzger’s recollections agree: “The iPod was white because the second-generation iBook was white. Most of the things Jony Ive did historically at design school back in England were white, and he started pushing white at Apple.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Initially, Jobs’s instincts were against white products. Satzger at one <a id="pageMap_183"></a>point developed a keyboard in arctic white; when Jobs hated it, he’d presented different shades, none of them strictly white. His range of whites for plastic materials included shades he called cloud white, snow white, and glacial white. Another was moon gray, which appeared white but was actually gray. When Satzger showed Jobs a moon gray chip, he could offer reassuringly, “It’s not white.” A sly move, as Jobs approved the moon gray keyboard. Likewise, the iconic iPod headphone cables weren’t white, but moon gray. “Moon gray and seashell gray were shades developed by us at Apple that were so close to white as to appear almost white, but were in fact gray,” explained Satzger.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The white plastic face of the iPod was coated with a very thin, transparent Perspex layer that gave it its sheen. The transparent layer was raised so little above the iPod’s front that it could only be seen when held sideways on. This was the iPod’s clear, sealed lid. The clear coating also put “quite a strong, almost a halo around the product,” said Jony.<a id="SuperscriptNumber261"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber261" class="calibre2">11</a></sup> It dazzled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With the iPod coming together, everyone got more and more excited. Steve Jobs was working almost every day with Robbin and Wasko on iTunes and the UI, while Jony and his team were occupied with perfecting the ID. The pressure to deliver was high but, even at the time, the team sensed they were making something remarkable. “The design of the iPod turned into a really personal project,” said Jony. “I mean, I love music. The team loves music. And I think collectively, it’s a product we’re looking forward to getting our hands on.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber262"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber262" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">New prototypes had to be delivered on Fridays, which was unusual, because prototypes were usually on hand in the middle of the week so that they could be worked on during rest of the week. Though Jobs’s daily involvement wasn’t widely known because the project was siloed, some members of the Dulcimer team suspected that Jobs was taking the prototypes home on Fridays, and playing with them over the weekend. <a id="pageMap_184"></a>One reason for such suspicions was the rash of new demands that arrived on many a Monday.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Prior to launch of the new player, nothing was left out of consideration, including the new product’s packaging. The packaging became almost as important as the overall product design. Previously, boxes were designed primarily for shipping, but with the iPod, the design team focused on the customer, rather than the transport company. The decision was made to design separate shipping containers and retail boxes so the customer wouldn’t be taking home his or her iPod in a plain-Jane shipping box. The result was an elaborate box that cradled the iPod like a piece of jewelry. “The iPod was the first product where we thought about the packaging as almost as important as the overall product design,” Satzger explained. “Packaging, it’s just as important as everything else.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In August, one of the physical iPod prototypes finally played a song. A group of people working late that night took turns listening to music on the new gadget, hooked up to headphones from someone’s old Sony Walkman. That first song was Spiller’s “Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love),” a house-music dance tune with vocals by the British diva Sophie Ellis-Bextor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, my God,” Jobs said. “This is gonna be so cool.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber263"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber263" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
