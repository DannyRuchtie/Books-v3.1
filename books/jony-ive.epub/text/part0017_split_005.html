			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">There are intriguing symmetries and continuities to be observed in Jony’s life and career. His father was an education reformer whose work directly affected his son’s design schooling. Jony’s first school projects were futuristic phones in white plastic. A prototype tablet got him his job at Apple.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s career has been marked by connections (Grinyer, Brunner) and coincidences (Brunner moving to Apple). But if there have been a few lucky breaks, it is equally true that he made his own luck.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was always crazy for design. As a kid, he wasn’t just talented, he was a design prodigy. He was aided by his dad, whose personal passion was instilling a passion for design in Britain’s school kids. His education at Newcastle Polytechnic was very hands-on, likewise developing his ongoing interest in making, which would be apparent again later in his love of making prototypes and pioneering new forms of mass production.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_268"></a>Jony’s early experience as a consultant at Tangerine built in him a consultant’s mentality and workflow, which Jony brought to Apple, where the design studio operates like a consultancy, only within a large corporation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I had been concerned that moving away from working independently for a number of clients on a broad range of products would be difficult,” he once said. “Surprisingly this has not been an issue, as we are really designing systems that include so many different components—headphones, remote controls, a mouse, speakers as well as computers.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber377"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber377" class="calibre2">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some of Jony’s first work at Apple, including the Newton MessagePad and the Twentieth Anniversary Mac, were harbingers. Jony hired many of the core members of his team when Apple was in difficulty, and he protected and nurtured them during Apple’s darkest days. It was this team that would contribute so much to Apple’s smash hits in the years that followed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His collaboration with Steve Jobs, starting with the iMac, became nothing less than one of the most fruitful creative partnerships in history. Together they reset Apple’s engineering-driven culture and created a much more tightly integrated design-driven approach, where “design” (meaning creative engineering, whether it’s hardware, software or advertising) permeated everything the company does.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The products that followed sent Jony deep into new materials and manufacturing methods, driven by his desire always to find a better way. The iPod was a product of Jony’s simplification philosophy. It could have been just another complex MP3 player, but instead he turned it into the iconic gadget that set the design cues for later mobile devices. Two more delightful innovations, the iPhone and iPad, were products of thinking differently, of creative engineering at work in rational problem solving on many levels.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The unibody process is Jony’s genius for simplification applied to <a id="pageMap_269"></a>process manufacturing. With his work in machining, it’s not unreasonable to say he achieved some pinnacle of making on an industrial scale. No wonder D&amp;AD, in 2012, named Apple the best design studio and best brand of the past fifty years. D&amp;AD awards are the Oscars of the industry, and Jony has ten of them, more than any other designer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The process of simplification is design 101, a mind-set that every design student is taught in school. But not every student adopts it, and it’s rarely applied with the ruthless discipline practiced by Jony. Indeed, if there’s such a thing as a single secret to what Jony Ive does, it is to follow slavishly the simplification philosophy. That approach has accounted for many of the major breakthroughs, as well as for some products that failed and others that Apple hasn’t released. Caring enough to commit the enormous time and effort to get something right has also been Jony’s hallmark, from his earliest college projects onward.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s ultimate goal is for his designs to disappear. The shy boy from Chingford is happiest when the user doesn’t notice his work at all. “It’s a very strange thing for a designer to say, but one of the things that really irritates me in products is when I’m aware of designers wagging their tails in my face,” he said. “Our goal is simple objects, objects that you can’t imagine any other way. . . . Get it right, and you become closer and more focused on the object. For instance, the iPhoto app we created for the new iPad, it completely consumes you and you forget you are using an iPad.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber378"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber378" class="calibre2">29</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Andrew Hargadon, a design and innovation professor at the University of California at Davis, who worked in Apple’s design studio before Jony took over, said not only has Jony made computers and smartphones indispensable, he’s also driving a cultural shift for better design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When the iMac first came out in jelly bean colors, so many other different products came out following that lead. There were staplers in <a id="pageMap_270"></a>six jelly bean colors. The iMac turned consumers into design aficionados to a much greater degree than they were before,” Hargadon said. “That’s probably the single greatest effect, that we nowadays expect many things to have better designs. Because of Apple, we got to compare crappy portable computers versus really nice ones, crappy phones versus really nice ones. We saw a before-and-after effect. Not over a generation, but within a few years. Suddenly 600 million people had a phone that put to shame the phone they used to have. That is a design education at work within our culture.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber379"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber379" class="calibre2">30</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s challenge now is to keep Apple fresh and innovative. In the dark days before Jobs returned, the biggest risk was not being risky. If Apple hadn’t taken risks—some of which paid off big—it might have been out of the game. Today, as an immensely successful corporation with established territories and a dominant place in several markets, the danger has passed and, with each generation of Apple’s products, the generational leaps grow more incremental and pose fewer risks.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But Apple’s success—and the continuity that Jony has brought to the company—has come to mean that the customer can now almost anticipate what a product is going to look like; the shock of the new is gone. “Apple has created a very careful brand DNA, which has however become a noose around their necks, from which they cannot shift,” warned Professor Alex Milton. “Apple has gone from being the alternative to the mainstream.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber380"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber380" class="calibre2">31</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Milton sees this as a tension for Jony, given that more recent graduates of the sort of design schools he attended are now rejecting that aesthetic. “Ive is the establishment,” asserted Milton. “The challenge for Ive is, can he reinvent himself, or is he stuck in time?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apple has to find a new language, and the challenge is, what is, that going to be? I have confidence that Jony Ive has the wherewithal to drive the next step for Apple, but this is by far the most difficult point.”</p>
