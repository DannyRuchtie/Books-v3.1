<h2 class="x05-Head" id="calibre_pb_3">Jobs Brings Focus</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">When Jobs returned, he brought focus not just to the company but to Jony’s design group.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was ostensibly in charge of the design squad, but the team’s efforts weren’t unified. Young and inexperienced as a manager, Jony wasn’t exerting much discipline or leadership. It was creative chaos, just like the rest of the company. The design department was full of talented but willful designers, each working on his or her own projects with little or no coordination.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Each designer had his own agenda, or their own design impulse, and there was no control [over their activities],” designer Doug Satzger said. “One designer had an agenda over what a laptop should be; another had an agenda over what a printer should be. There was no consistency on what the next Power Mac tower should be. The design group was not set up so that designers could work collaboratively as a team. All the designers were independent and had their own strong design sense. It was like they were all working for different companies.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger said three designers were working on three different updates of the Power Mac, a powerful computer for professionals that came in a <a id="pageMap_114"></a>tower configuration. “There was no consistency,” said Satzger. “Danny [De Iuliis] had designed a perfect cube with wheels on it. It was pretty big. Danny Coster was working on a model that consisted of various blocks thrown together, while the design of Thomas Meyerhoffer’s [another member of the ID team] for the tower was all slurpy with lines all over—it was a monolithic piece of art. And the team was going ahead with not one of them but all of them.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber167"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber167" class="calibre2">17</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Esslinger and Brunner, in their times, had allowed designers to explore different design directions. Brunner in particular liked to treat the early design process almost as a competition. But he’d eventually choose the best ideas, and Esslinger, too, would unify the best ideas into a single design direction. Jony had worked in this kind of environment for several years, but didn’t seem willing or able to provide a strong lead.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs stepped in, shutting down unpromising projects and trimming back Apple’s product line to suit his 2×2 matrix. Satzger remembers Jobs coming to the studio and telling the designers that Apple would be putting all its energies behind just four products. First and foremost would be a desktop for consumers. “Steve said, ‘My daughter is going to college, and I’ve looked at everything out there and they’re all crap. There’s a real opportunity. Our target now is to build an Internet computer.’ He was envisioning the iMac. That was the new focus.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs wanted an inexpensive computer, something that would appeal to mainstream consumers eager to try out the Internet, which was just becoming popular thanks to Netscape’s Navigator browser, cheap modems and an explosion in Internet service providers (ISPs) like AOL, which offered inexpensive Internet access plans. And he wanted it quickly. He’d cut back the company to give it breathing room, but he needed new products quickly to restore plunging sales. He was betting the company on this one product.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the time, Apple’s cheapest computer was $2,000, more than $800 <a id="pageMap_115"></a>above the average Windows PC. To be competitive against cheaper Windows offerings, Jobs initially pushed for a radically stripped-back machine called a “network computer” (also known as an NC), a hot idea in Silicon Valley at the time. The NC would be a cheap, simple terminal that connected to a central server over the Internet. It had no hard drive or optical disk drives, just a screen and keyboard. It was perfect for schools and workplaces and it seemed, at first glance, ideal for consumers eager to access the Internet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Before Jobs’s return, in May 1996, Apple had joined Oracle Corporation and thirty other hardware and software companies in the Networking Computing Alliance, which set the standard for cheap, diskless computers based on a common networking platform. Jobs’s billionaire best friend, Larry Ellison, was especially bullish on NCs as the future of the computer industry. And as a newly installed member of Apple’s board, Ellison told the press that Apple was building an NC. He’d recently launched a start-up, Network Computing Inc., to kick-start the sector.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Influenced by Ellison’s thinking, but also eager to compete with him, Jobs also talked up the NC idea. “We’re going to beat Ellison at his own game,” he told his Apple colleagues with relish.<a id="SuperscriptNumber168"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber168" class="calibre2">18</a></sup> Just as he’d done with the first Macintosh, Jobs began by laying out certain specifications: The Mac NC should be an all-in-one product, ready to use right out of the box, in a distinctive design that made a brand statement. And it should sell for $1,200 or so. “He told us to go back to the roots of the original 1984 Macintosh, an all-in-one consumer appliance,” recalled Apple’s marketing chief, Phil Schiller. “That meant design and engineering had to work together.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber169"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber169" class="calibre2">19</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In September 1997, Jon Rubinstein instructed Jony to take Jobs’s Mac NC specs and prepare a dozen foam models of potential designs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Jony gathered the entire team in the design studio to hash it out. They started by discussing the Mac NC’s potential target market. “We didn’t <a id="pageMap_116"></a>start with engineering dictates,” Jony said. “We actually started with people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The iMac revolved not around chip speed or market share but squishy questions like ‘How do we want people to feel about it?’ and ‘What part of our minds should it occupy?’” Jony said later in a <em class="calibre3">Newsweek</em> interview.<a id="SuperscriptNumber170"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber170" class="calibre2">20</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony was looking for the Mac NC’s “design story.” As his dad, Mike, had instilled in him, developing the design story was an essential first step in conceiving something entirely new. “As industrial designers we no longer design objects,” Jony said. “We design the user’s perceptions of what those objects are, as well as the meaning that accrues from their physical existence, their function and the sense of possibility they offer.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber171"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber171" class="calibre2">21</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They discussed topics like “objects that dispense positive emotions”; one of the designers suggested a transparent gumball dispenser as an example of this. The IDg also discussed how other businesses, like the fashion industry, might approach the problem. “We talked about companies like Swatch—companies that broke the rules—that viewed technology as a way to the consumer, not the consumer as the path to the technology,” Jony said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Later, Jony explained his thinking this way. The computer industry “is an industry that has become incredibly conservative from a design perspective,” he said. “It is an industry where there is an obsession about product attributes that you can measure empirically. How fast is it? How big is the hard drive? How fast is the CD? That is a very comfortable space to compete in because you can say eight is better than six.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber172"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber172" class="calibre2">22</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But Jony offered a key insight: “It’s also very inhuman and very cold. Because of the industry’s obsession with absolutes, there has been a tendency to ignore product attributes that are difficult to measure or talk about. In that sense, the industry has missed out on the more emotive, <a id="pageMap_117"></a>less tangible product attributes. But to me, that is why I bought an Apple computer in the first place. That is why I came to work for Apple. It’s because I’ve always sensed that Apple had a desire to do more than the bare minimum. It wasn’t just going to do what was functionally and empirically necessary. In the early stuff, I got a sense that care was taken even on details, hard and soft, that people may never discover.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber173"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber173" class="calibre2">23</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sitting around a table, Jony and the rest of team started sketching. Satzger remembered the table was covered with loose sheets of copy paper, colored pencils and Pilot pens. The team drew up ideas together as a collective, passing the loose sheets between them as they worked. Trying to imagine a machine that dispensed positive emotions, as they hoped the iMac would, designer Chris Stringer made a beautiful sketch of a colorful candy dispenser.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Satzger remembers coming up with the initial egg shape for the iMac, based on TVs he had previously designed for Thomson Consumer Electronics. “If you look at the shape, it’s almost exactly the same profile.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The idea appealed to Jony and the rest of the team. Immediately, the decision was made to pursue the egg shape as the primary design direction.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iMac had to be on the market in a matter of months or Apple would go out of business. To speed up the design process, Jony instigated a radical, integrated design process that transformed the way Apple developed its products. The workflow that the design group uses today is basically unchanged from the system Jony introduced.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The IDg needed new tools that could streamline the complex design process and allow the designers to create 3-D designs that, in turn, could be used by outside toolmakers at the factories to create the molds for the computer’s case. Marj Andresen, who worked in the product design group, was instrumental in helping Jony find sophisticated CAD <a id="pageMap_118"></a>software to bring the new machine to life. The new CAD modeling process Jony helped pioneer integrated disparate computing systems, using complex software that translated files to make them interoperable.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I was given nine months to get the tools into production,” recalled Andresen, who calls herself a “CAD/CAM therapist” because of her role supporting high-strung designers. “Nine months to get from design to production was a very short time and impossible with drawings,” said Andresen. “Our only hope was to use the design files directly. While the tools existed, the process hadn’t yet been proved on either the engineering or the tooling end. It was crazy and hectic and exciting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Prior to the iMac, hardware engineering (electrical design) and product design (mechanical engineering) drove the design process. “They designed the size of the enclosure due to engineering constraints and ID were tasked to develop ‘skins’ to go around this enclosure,” said Paul Dunn, a former CAD manager at Apple. “When Jobs returned to Apple, he and Jony turned this process on its head.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although Jony’s group had a small CAD team in the studio, it was still the early days of computer-aided design. The designers worked mostly with hand-drawn sketches and some early, relatively primitive 2-D CAD software. But Jony’s team needed to design in three dimensions, not two.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They found the answer in Alias Wavefront, a 3-D graphics package used in the aerospace, automotive and the fledgling computer-animation industry. Steve Jobs’s other company, Pixar, had used it for some special effects in <em class="calibre3">Toy Story</em>, released in 1995.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apple was producing designs much more complicated than any of our computer rivals,” said Dunn. “The surfaces on [the iMac] were more akin to the aerospace and automotive industries than the computer industry. . . . We were pushing the envelope.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber174"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber174" class="calibre2">24</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Alias Wavefront is, in effect, a sculpting tool; it defines the outer <a id="pageMap_119"></a>envelope of a product, much like a sculptor models a work in clay. As soon as the designers had a promising shape sketched out, they took it to the CAD group, who are also known as “surfacing guys.” At the time, IDg had a small group of operators; it’s now grown to about fifteen surfacing guys who are based inside the IDg studio. They run Alias (now called Autodesk Alias) on high-end Apple computers and Hewlett-Packard workstations. With Jony’s designers watching over their shoulders, the CAD operators created outlines of the proposed designs. The idea was to make sure the basic shapes and scale were sound.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The process often takes several days. When the designers and surfacing guys settle on a reasonably good shape, they send the file to one of the studio’s CNC milling machines to create a physical model. The initial models are cut from foam, and later, more detailed “hard models” are cut from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or RenShape, a dense red foam that cuts like wood and is good for surfaces.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The design group in Jony’s early days also had an early and very expensive 3-D printer in the studio. “Apple had been at the forefront of modeling technology for many years,” said Dunn. “From the early nineties, Apple’s modeling group had a stereolithography (SLA) machine which could create complex 3-D models in several hours. The chemicals were extremely toxic, but the results were worth all the hassles.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Jony discovered in college, making detailed models was a key part of the design process. “When you see the most dramatic shift is when you transition from an abstract idea to a slightly more material conversation,” Jony said. “But when you made a 3-D model, however crude, you bring form to a nebulous idea, and everything changes—the entire process shifts. It galvanizes and brings focus from a broad group of people. It’s a remarkable process.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber175"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber175" class="calibre2">25</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">With this new workflow arrangement, Jony consolidated the model shop into the design studio (previously it had been under the aegis of <a id="pageMap_120"></a>product design). Andresen says it was a sensible move, organizationally and operationally. “The model shop gave the ID guys a first look and feel at the product design. They were creating one-off models of what products might look like. . . . [T]hey really had the coolest stuff.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber176"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber176" class="calibre2">26</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The modeling guys were essential to the product process. “Our model shop guys were craftsmen,” Andresen remembered. “They could build anything, but they had to learn how to use the new computer tools and to accept the design files from the engineers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another important piece of software in reimagining the design process was Unigraphics, a 3-D engineering program developed by McDonnell Douglas for use in aerospace. Andresen and her group created software that allowed the 3-D models created by the surfacing guys in Alias to be imported into Unigraphics. From there, the product design group used Unigraphics to create workable products from the surfaces determined by the designers. The engineers would bring in detailed 3-D models of the product’s components, allowing them to see whether the components would fit, and if the proposed shape would work. “The designers would sit with the CAD guys and say, ‘Bring in the CRT tube. Here we need some volume for board, a place for connectors,’ and so on,” said Satzger. “Processes and interfaces were developed which allowed us to take these surfaces and import them into Unigraphics, which Product Design then used as the starting point to develop real solids and parts for manufacture,” said Dunn.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The whole process was iterative. The designers worked constantly alongside the CAD operators and engineers, fiddling with the arrangements until they found a workable combination of outer skin and internal components. “It all sounds so simple, but it was very difficult, repetitive and time consuming,” said Roy Askeland, a former Apple designer who worked on the iMac. “It was defining minute details, millimeters at a time.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber177"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber177" class="calibre2">27</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_121"></a>The last part of the puzzle involved sending the detailed 3-D CAD files to the mold makers. When it came to making the molds at the factory, toolmakers had previously relied on hand-drawn sketches and 2-D CAD printouts, which looked like blueprints. Although the factories had their own CAM systems to make the molds, they weren’t always compatible with the designers’ systems, so translating the design group’s sketches and models into molds at the factory was still semi-manual and could take many months. The software Andresen helped create enabled all the systems to share common files, vastly simplifying and speeding up the process.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Although the parallel design workflow was overall faster with these improvements, the system didn’t run smoothly. “It was a difficult move to pull off and it didn’t feed nicely to CAM [computer-aided manufacturing] systems, either in house or at suppliers,” said Andresen. “As we moved into surface modeling the limitations on the software and the hardware slowed us down considerably. Computers went from being boxy to having rounded corners and edges. These were very difficult to model and also very difficult for our suppliers to receive. . . . [W]e had multiple systems and even more system translation complexity.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Nonetheless, the bugs were worked out and the revolutionary process underlies IDg’s workflow even today. “The design process basically revolves around two main systems: Wavefront and Unigraphics,” said Dunn. “Yes, many interfaces and post-processors had to be developed, and some of them were very complicated, but the overall process wasn’t that bad once it had been defined.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber178"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber178" class="calibre2">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Andresen said Apple’s innovative designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s pushed the envelope of what CAD tools could handle at the time. “It’s funny to think about now when I have 3-D modeling running on my iPad . . . but back then the idea of modeling what it looked like to build a computer out of aluminum and actually shine a light on the <a id="pageMap_122"></a>casing was unimaginable. The CAD vendors were struggling to keep up with our demands. We had to bring them into our ID and PD labs to show them what we needed. Between computers and automotive we were forcing the CAD industry to come up with lots of new software.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">During that first month, Jony’s team built at least ten models for the Mac NC—but they didn’t show them all to Jobs. Jony’s team knew right away they wanted the egg shape, so they shared only variations of that shape. “When it came to showing models to Steve Jobs, we would select models that we ourselves thought were good,” said Satzger. “Steve would then approve—or not. Many times he said simply no to a model design. But we never presented anything to Steve that we didn’t want him to pick.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Jony first showed Jobs the egg-shaped machine in the studio, he rejected it. But Jony persisted. He agreed with Jobs that it wasn’t quite right, but suggested it had a sense of fun. It was playful. “It has a sense that it’s just arrived on your desktop or it’s just about to hop off and go somewhere,” he told Jobs.<a id="SuperscriptNumber179"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber179" class="calibre2">29</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next time Jony showed the egg shape to Jobs, the boss went nuts for it. Jobs started carrying the Foam Core model around campus, showing it to people to gauge their reaction. At the same time, he was cooling to the idea of a stripped-down network computer. Competing NCs already on the market, such as Microsoft’s WebTV and Apple’s own Pippin, sold by Bandai as @Mark in Japan, were getting zero traction in the marketplace.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs ordered the NC be upgraded to a real computer with, among other things, a bigger hard drive and an optical drive. To prevent any delays, Rubinstein suggested the hardware should be based on the G3 desktop, a machine for professionals that had been in the pipeline before Jobs took over and had just been released. The addition of a hard <a id="pageMap_123"></a>drive and an optical drive meant enlarging the egg-shaped enclosure, but it was a relatively simple operation of scaling it up. Jony charged Danny Coster to take lead of the design.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iMac was going to be made in plastic—it would be an “unashamedly plastic” product, in Jony’s words—but plastic came with difficulties. “We didn’t want it to look trashy,” Jony explained later. “There’s a fine line you walk between affordable and cheap. We certainly wanted it to appear affordable, and we wanted to make it clear that this isn’t a terrifying technology—a technology that still alienates a huge number of people.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber180"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber180" class="calibre2">30</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony’s group made models in a reddish blue, almost purple, and in orange, but the solid plastic looked cheap, so someone suggested the case be transparent. Jony immediately approved of the idea. “It came across as cheeky,” he said. “That’s why we liked translucency.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber181"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber181" class="calibre2">31</a></sup> Transparent plastic had already started to creep into some of Apple’s products, like printer trays and covers; the clamshell-shaped eMate, designed by Thomas Meyerhoffer, was made entirely of transparent plastic. At the time, Meyerhoffer told <em class="calibre3">Macweek</em> that translucency gave the eMate a sense of accessibility by allowing users to see inside.<a id="SuperscriptNumber182"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber182" class="calibre2">32</a></sup> Once Jony decided to make the iMac transparent, he realized the internals would have to be designed with care, too, since they would now be visible. Jony was particularly worried about the electromagnetic shielding that went around some of the internal components, which in opaque products was usually hidden in a big, ugly sheet metal box.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony had the designers bring all the different transparent-colored items they could find into the studio for inspiration. “We had a taillight from a BMW,” said Satzger. “A lot of kitchen accessories. An old transparent thermos. Cheap flatware for picnics. We had a whole product shelf, full of these transparent products. We studied the qualities, the depth of a transparent product. The textures on the inside. The thermos <a id="pageMap_124"></a>was a big inspiration. It was a deep shiny blue, with a shiny thermos flask reflecting inside.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber183"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber183" class="calibre2">33</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Indeed, the final iMac, with its silver internal shielding visible through the transparent shell, resembles the transparent thermos married to a car taillight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of the designers brought in a small piece of beach glass, greenish blue in color, with a softly frosted surface. It might have come from Half Moon Bay, California, or Sydney’s Bondi Beach in Australia, where Coster liked to surf. When Jony presented Steve with three models to choose among, he included this green/blue tint (that Jony’s team called Bondi Blue) along with orange and purple models. Jobs selected the Bondi Blue.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The transparency added a sense of accessibility, but in order to give the iMac an even more approachable feel, the designers added a handle on top. For Jony, the handle on the iMac was not really for carrying it around, but to build a bond with the consumer by encouraging them to touch it. It was an important but almost intangible innovation that would change the way people interacted with computers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Back then, people weren’t comfortable with technology,” Jony explained. “If you’re scared of something, then you won’t touch it. I could see my mum being scared to touch it. So I thought, if there’s this handle on it, it makes a relationship possible. It’s approachable. It’s intuitive. It gives you permission to touch. It gives a sense of its deference to you.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber184"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber184" class="calibre2">34</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The idea came with a downside, according to Jony. “Unfortunately, manufacturing a recessed handle costs a lot of money. At the old Apple, I would have lost the argument. What was really great about Steve is that he saw it and said, ‘That’s cool!’ I didn’t explain all the thinking, but he intuitively got it. He just knew that it was part of the iMac’s friendliness and playfulness.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_125"></a>The iMac was code-named Columbus because it represented a new world. As Jony later expressed it, “With the first iMac the goal wasn’t to look different, but to build the best integrated consumer computer we could. If as a consequence the shape is different, then that’s how it is. The thing is, it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Over the years, Apple had acquired a lot of legacy technologies, those elements that are becoming obsolete but aren’t quite there yet. The fast-moving technology industry is full of them. At the time, Apple’s legacy technologies included various parallel and serial ports for connecting mice, keyboards, printers and other peripherals. Like most computer makers, Apple tended to accommodate as many legacy technologies as possible. The company was loathe to lose a sale for the lack of a connector to hook up some old printer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs decided to make the iMac the first “legacy-free” computer. He ditched the old ADB, SCSI and serial ports, and included only Ethernet, infrared and USB. He also abandoned the floppy drive, a decision that drew more controversy than any other. These changes reflected Jobs’s simplification philosophy, which would soon come into play in many products. Jony, too, would become a master of the approach, agreeing with Jobs’s mantra: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber185"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber185" class="calibre2">35</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">USB, now a standard technology for connecting peripherals, was a particularly gutsy choice to include in the nineties. Invented by Intel, the USB 1.1 standard hadn’t even been finalized yet (and wouldn’t be until September 1998, a month after the iMac’s release). It had no traction in the industry yet but Jobs was betting it would solve the increasingly vexing problem of special accessories for the Mac platform. As the Mac’s market share shrank, fewer and fewer peripheral makers were willing to make hardware with special connectors just for the tiny Mac market. But USB peripherals could be made Mac-compatible with <a id="pageMap_126"></a>the addition of just the software to drive them, and, if necessary, Apple could write these so-called drivers itself.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To make the ports accessible, Jony located them on the side of the machine. “One of the things that makes the backs of most computers look so agricultural is the ton of cables pouring out,” said Jony. “We moved the connectors to the side, which, functionally, makes them much easier to get to and keeps the back quite simple. The back of my computer may as well be its front in terms of what you see.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Characteristically, Jony sweated the details, including the power cable, which he also wanted to be transparent. “You know how, when you take a shower, condensation forms on the glass? We wanted that same kind of exquisite matte surface finish on the cable.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber186"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber186" class="calibre2">36</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The transparent mouse made Jony particularly proud. “If you know how mice work, it’s quite intriguing,” he said. “You see through the Apple logo, like a little window on the top of the mouse, into this little mouse factory. You see the ball moving on twin axles—well, it’s actually pretty complicated and intriguing what goes on inside the mouse besides the ball rolling. We’ve tried fairly hard to layer what you can see inside. For the most part you just get a sense of what’s inside—a sense of materials reflecting light and a sense of forms and shapes. It’s only occasionally that you get a more literal view of what’s going on inside.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber187"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber187" class="calibre2">37</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the downside, Jony’s perfectly round mouse proved to be an ergonomic nightmare. It was skittish on tabletops and difficult to orient properly; it was always pointing in the wrong direction and was too small for many adults. Users had to pinch their hands into a claw to use it, giving them cramps. Jobs was told that the mouse would be a problem, but in his race to market, he ignored the advice.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As a regular presence in the design studio, Jobs was getting excited about Columbus and the radical redesigns coming out of Jony’s studio. Marjorie Andresen, the CAD expert, said the optimism and vision of <a id="pageMap_127"></a>Jony’s design group was infectious. “The engineers tended to be more grounded in what was possible today,” she said. “The industrial designers were clearly imagining what would be possible tomorrow and in the future.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple set up a special factory in South Korea, where the iMac would be assembled in partnership with LG. But the manufacturing engineers raised concerns about the cost of the iMac’s design. Satzger said the tooling for the case was very complex. “It was the first time we really started challenging tooling and injection molding standards.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As head of the engineering group, Rubinstein had to balance the concerns of all parties. Though Rubinstein tended to side with the engineers, Jobs usually sided with Jony and his team.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When we took it to the engineers they came up with thirty-eight reasons they couldn’t do it,” Jobs recalled. “And I said, ‘No, no, we’re doing this.’ And they said, ‘Well, why?’ And I said, ‘Because I’m the CEO, and I think it can be done.’ And so they kind of grudgingly did it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber188"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber188" class="calibre2">38</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller put the push-pull in context. “Before Steve came back, engineers would say ‘Here are the guts’—processor, hard drive—and then it would go to the designers to put it in a box. When you do it that way, you come up with awful products.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber189"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber189" class="calibre2">39</a></sup> But Jobs and Jony tilted the balance again toward the designers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Steve kept impressing on us that the design was integral to what would make us great,” said Schiller. “Design once again dictated the engineering, not just vice versa.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What Steve Jobs brought to the table was no compromise,” said Don Norman. “He focused on what the product was supposed to be and he didn’t listen to opposing arguments. To be sure, he listened before he made up his mind, but once he made up his mind, that was it. Before Steve, there were a lot of compromises, which led to less cohesiveness and delayed production.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber190"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber190" class="calibre2">40</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_128"></a>Some of Jobs’s leadership began to rub off on Jony. “There was a kind of hierarchy of talent in the room and it was palpable. . . . [I]t was easy to see that Jony was a leader early on and that other designers looked to him for approval,” recalled Andresen. She contends that while the IDg had been full of talented people in the Brunner era, she felt the atmosphere became “charged with ideas” once Jony was in charge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Andresen remembers the time fondly. “It was fast, it was exciting and it felt like everything we were doing was really really critical. Time to market was drummed into our heads and we did anything and everything we could in order to save time getting products from concept to customer. ID—and Jonathan—was where it all started.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As the iMac neared completion, Jony’s IDg worked day and night to perfect every detail. Shaking his head at the memory, Saltzer said, “We were working 24-hour shifts.”</p>
