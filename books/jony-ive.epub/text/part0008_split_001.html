			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Despite his intentions to build a dream team, about eighteen months passed before Brunner began hiring in earnest. He needed to make the case for more resources with Apple executives but, perhaps more important, he had to come up with a cool place for the designers to work.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“[The studio] was essential to recruiting talent,” Brunner said. “I can’t have people working in cubicle hell. They won’t do it. I have to have an open studio with high ceilings and cool shit going on. That’s <a id="pageMap_68"></a>just really important. It’s important for the quality of the work. It’s important for getting people to do it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber115"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber115" class="calibre2">5</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner found part of the answer in an underutilized building that Apple was leasing at 20730 Valley Green Drive. Called Valley Green II, or VGII, the building was a large, low-slung Spanish-style stucco structure surrounded by a few small trees and a big parking lot. Not far from Apple’s main campus, Valley Green Drive is on the other side of De Anza Boulevard, the main road through the center of Cupertino. Almost all of the buildings in the area are leased by Apple, making this part of Cupertino look like a company town. Apple’s first office, on Bandley Drive, is just around the corner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner took over half of the building, a big open space with twenty-five-foot-plus ceilings. He would share the building with Apple’s Creative Services group, known as Apple’s “In-House Design Consultants,” who were called on to produce things like brochures, manuals, in-store posters and displays and video promos.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another crucial consideration for Brunner was that the building was not directly under the noses of Apple’s meddlesome executives. “I liked that it was off the beaten path.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner worked with Studios, a big San Francisco architecture and design firm, to transform the interior into an appealing design studio. Apple’s practice was to use standardized office furniture from Herman Miller, the company credited with inventing the cubicle, but Brunner didn’t assemble it into cubes. Instead, the desks were arranged in unusual formations around the space. “We used the taller structures as spines running around the studio and the work spaces running off it,” said Brunner. “The corporate planning people didn’t get it. They said you can’t do that, but that’s what we did, put it together in different ways. It totally freaked them out. It was great, a lot of fun. We just made it less oppressive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner had a CAD workstation installed for creating 3-D models <a id="pageMap_69"></a>of designs along with a computer numeric controls (CNC) milling machine to turn the CAD models into foam ones and a paint shop for testing different colors.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The ID studio at Apple was a cool work space,” recalled Rick English, a photographer who did a lot of work with Apple in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1997, English contributed photos to Kunkel’s book about the design group, <em class="calibre3">AppleDesign</em>, but he also worked with a lot of other design studios in the Valley. To his eye, Apple seemed different. It wasn’t just the tools and their focus; the place was rapidly populated with designer toys, too, including spendy bikes, skateboards, diving equipment, a movie projector and hundreds of films. “It fostered this really creative, take-a-risk atmosphere, which I didn’t see at other firms,” said English.<a id="SuperscriptNumber116"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber116" class="calibre2">6</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Brunner began recruiting in earnest, he initially found attracting talent difficult. Apple had no reputation for doing its own design, having outsourced it to Frog, and talented, ambitious designers were more inclined to go to firms with a strong creative history like the Bay Area’s IDEO.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">To help with recruiting, Brunner took a leaf from Tangerine’s playbook and started promoting his work through design magazines. He created mock-ups of fantastical Apple products and ran big glossy photos of them on the back of <em class="calibre3">I.D.</em> magazine, the international design bible. One was a gigantic bicycle navigation computer that showed maps and local landmarks on a black-and-white screen. Another was a chunky wristwatch computer the size of a cantaloupe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They were concepts, not real products,” said Brunner. “They started to get attention. It was totally recruiting. No other reason. They were sketchy, information appliance models. A little bit tongue in cheek, but it served its purpose.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber117"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber117" class="calibre2">7</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Over time, Brunner recruited a team of talented designers, some of whom would remain with Apple for decades and be responsible for a <a id="pageMap_70"></a>string of hit products, including the iPhone and iPad. Key members of Brunner’s team were Tim Parsey, Daniele De Iuliis, Lawrence Lam, Jay Meschter, Larry Barbera, Calvin Seid and Bart Andre.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Daniele De Iuliis (day-YOU-lease) was perhaps the most precocious of the group. Born in Bristol, United Kingdom, of Italian descent, De Iuliis was a graduate of the Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in London. Brunner hired him in 1991 from the San Francisco office of design group ID Two (where Jony’s friend Clive Grinyer had earlier worked).</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner specifically wanted designers with experience in consulting. “After experiencing the inertia that exists inside Apple, Bob realized that by hiring former consultants he could operate with the speed and efficiency of a freelance group,” said Tim Parsey. “As a former consultant, Bob knew that we would think and act like consultants.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber118"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber118" class="calibre2">8</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Fellow designer Barbera was impressed with De Iuliis’s personality right away: “Danny, in particular, gave off that weird light that other designers tend to notice. I took one look at him and figured that our work was gonna get a lot better, fast.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber119"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber119" class="calibre2">9</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">De Iuliis was able to imbue his designs with strong personality, a skill that served him well later on. One of his early projects was the Macintosh Color Classic, an update of the original Mac that exuded character and was avidly collected by fans for years. He would later work on the MacBook Pro and the iPhones 4 and 5. His name appears on more than 560 patents. They’re vast and varied in scope, including innovations in 3-D cameras, multi-touch displays, location tracking, RFID transponders, nitriding stainless steel, magsafe charging mechanisms, the iPod and improved speaker enclosures.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Later in his career, De Iuliis would receive top design awards for his work. Once Jony joined the team, the two developed a strong relationship. De Iuliis and Jony lived close to each other in San Francisco, and commuted together for more than twenty years.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_71"></a>In 1992, Brunner recruited Bartley K. Andre (known as Bart), a graduate of the University of California at Long Beach and an intern in Apple’s Personal Intelligent Electronics, or PIE group. He would emerge as one of the top five patent holders in the United States on a year-to-year basis (thanks to his last name, he is listed on all of Apple’s major patents in the title: “United States Patent Application Andre et al.”). By 2013, Andre had more patents to his name than any other Apple designer, including Jony. In 2009 alone, he received 92 patents; in 2010, his 114 set a record for an Apple designer. Most of the patent awards were for innovations on the phone, tablet and laptop lines.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Andre worked on everything at ID, from circuit modules to RFID systems. He was credited with the design of Apple’s 035 design prototype of the first iPad, according to information released during the <em class="calibre3">Apple v. Samsung</em> trial in 2012. Along with other members of the team, he several times received the prestigious Red Dot Award, from Germany’s Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen institute.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Daniel J. Coster joined the team after Jony, arriving in June 1994. Described as “tall, goofy [and] super-talented,” Coster had earned an ID degree from the Wellington Polytechnic School in New Zealand in 1986. Initially hired on a three-month contract, he impressed the group with work on colors and finishes for the Newton portable, then was hired full time. He designed various towers and gained notice for being the lead designer of the Bondi Blue iMac. Like his coworkers, Coster rapidly accumulated patents, receiving nearly six hundred working for Apple over the last two decades. In 2012, Coster was inducted into his alma mater’s design Hall of Fame for “an outstanding contribution to New Zealand’s economy, reputation and national identity through art and design.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber120"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber120" class="calibre2">10</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When Jony joined the team, his arrival was much anticipated. “Bob knew the effect that a strong new designer would have on the group,” <a id="pageMap_72"></a>said Meschter. “When Daniele De Iuliis and Tim Parsey first arrived, our whole approach to design changed. But when Jonathan came on board . . . the group really took off.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber121"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber121" class="calibre2">11</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">To run the group like an outside consultancy but within Apple, Brunner set up a loose management structure that largely persists today. The designers always worked together on whatever project the group was working on. “We’d work on multiple projects, and move from project to project, pretty much the way he [Jony] does it today,” Brunner explained.<a id="SuperscriptNumber122"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber122" class="calibre2">12</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner also made about half a dozen of the designers “product line leaders” (PLLs) for Apple’s major product groups: CPUs, printers, monitors and so on. The PLLs acted as liaisons between the design group and the company, much in the way an outside design consultancy would operate. “The product groups felt there was a contact within the design group,” Brunner said. “They managed the communication and the different needs of each group. I didn’t know any better. I ran it like the Lunar studio. There’d be discussion of a project. We’d design it, make it and ship it.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber123"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber123" class="calibre2">13</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As Apple grew and thrived, riding the desktop publishing revolution and the exploding market for PCs, the group found itself with a massive workload. “We had an enormous number of products in the pipeline,” said Brunner. “Two lines of desktops, monitors, printers, mobile products. Way too many. It was an enormous amount of work. More than we could handle.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The production schedules also got shorter and shorter. When Brunner first started at Apple, the product development cycle was eighteen months or more. “It was crazy generous,” Brunner said. “You had an amazing amount of time to make something work.” Within a couple of years, however, the product development cycle shrank to <a id="pageMap_73"></a>twelve months, then nine, and sometimes even six months if the product was needed in a hurry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“All of a sudden, what got compressed was our thinking time,” Brunner said. “It still took just as long to implement something, but the time to explore, to test and to play with, just went away.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Another challenge to Brunner and his crew was that Apple’s internal culture heavily favored the engineers within the product groups: The design process was engineering driven. In the early days of Frog Design, the engineers had bent over backward to help implement the design team’s ambitions, but now the power had shifted. The different engineering groups gave their products in development to Brunner’s group, who were expected to merely “skin” them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner wanted to shift the power from engineering to design. He started thinking strategically. His off-line “parallel design investigations” were a key part of his strategy. “We began to do more longer-term thinking, longer-term studies around things like design language, how future technologies are implemented, what does mobility mean?” The idea was to get ahead of the engineering groups and start to make Apple more of a design-driven company, rather than a marketing or engineering one. “We wanted to get ahead of them, so we’d have more ammunition to bring to the process.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber124"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber124" class="calibre2">14</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For every skin job Brunner did for engineering, he’d launch up to ten different parallel design directions. It sometimes seemed that such investigations were set up as competitions. He’d have several designers—inside the group and out—submit initial concepts. “It was almost like a competition, which Bob encouraged,” said English. “Then, when one of those designs was selected it became that designer’s baby all the way ’til completion.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Juggernaut project with Jony at Tangerine had been one such parallel investigation, and several others unfolded with outside agencies <a id="pageMap_74"></a>like Lunar and IDEO. (This practice continues to this day at Apple, although both Jony and Steve Jobs avoided admitting it publicly.) The parallel design investigations also allowed the overworked design team to work with talented designers not on the Apple payroll. “Sometimes we wanted to hire specific designers to act as part of the team, to use them as freelance talent,” Brunner said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brunner was good at getting attention for the group, which inevitably led to design awards. Every month, Brunner ran ads on the rear cover of <em class="calibre3">I.D. </em>magazine. No longer limited to blue-sky concepts, Brunner published photos of designer prototypes, mostly to give his designers attention and make them feel good. It was an expensive motivational tool (Rick English said he was billing the company at least $250,000 a year in those days), but some of the work that the team had done was soon displayed in the studio as big photos on the wall.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Everything was documented. English and another photographer, Beverley Harper, photographed all the finished designs and a lot of the concepts. As they moved away from beige boxes, the designers felt the work deserved to be recorded. “The mind-set was that there was going to be a historical archive of all the things they worked on,” said English. “They absolutely believed that their work had such importance.” The habit lived on, as Jony’s design group continues to document everything it does today.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In hindsight, Brunner’s choices—the studio’s separation from the engineering groups, its loose structure, the collaborative workflow and consultancy mind-set—turned out to be fortuitous. One of the reasons Apple’s design team has remained so effective is that it retains Brunner’s original structure. It’s a small, tight, cohesive group of extremely talented designers who all work on design challenges together. Just like the designers had done at Lunar, Tangerine and other small agencies. The model worked.</p>
