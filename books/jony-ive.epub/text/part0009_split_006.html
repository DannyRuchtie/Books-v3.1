			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">The iMac saved Apple and cemented Steve Jobs’s reputation as a technology seer and leading arbiter of consumer trends. Business, design, advertising, TV, movies and music would all eventually feel the effect of the iMac. The iMac was also Jony’s coming-out party, the first product that gained him public attention. Overnight, Jony was celebrated as one of the world’s most daring and original designers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the next few years, the iMac sparked an explosion of see-through plastic products, from Swingline staplers to the George Foreman grill. It was impossible to visit stores like Target without seeing see-through cameras, hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, microwaves and TVs, aisle after aisle of translucent plastic products with bulbous, organic shapes. The trend was especially pronounced in personal electronics with portable transparent CD players, pagers and boom boxes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s one of the hottest things in product design today?” asked <em class="calibre3">USA TODAY</em> in December 2000. “Translucence.” The paper called it “electronics voyeurism.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber207"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber207" class="calibre2">57</a></sup> Several rival companies released Windows PCs that copied the iMac. Apple sued and shut down knockoffs from eMachines and Future Power.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No longer business tools hidden away in office cubicles, computers, thanks to the iMac, became fun and fashionable. Suddenly, people were proud to put an iMac in either their living room or on the reception desk at work. According to British design historian Penny Sparke, “The iMac . . . broke the mold of computers, which hitherto were masculine objects. Then they became much more desirable objects. It was a real breakthrough.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber208"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber208" class="calibre2">58</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><a id="pageMap_136"></a>Apple’s strategy of selling to individual consumers, rather than corporations, paid off. “There is a parallel here with the 1950s, when design had a lot of momentum,” noted Susan Yelavich, assistant director for public programs at Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution. “A whole new generation of products has technology as the underpinning. But, unlike in the past when technology was used in the office, today it is in and around the home.” She pointed out another key distinction: The advent of the iMac meant “office products [were] being marketed to teens.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber209"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber209" class="calibre2">59</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The iMac shifted the computer conversation entirely. Suddenly, thanks to the iMac, prosaic details like CPU speed became less important than good looks, ease of use or custom options.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony argued that it was the iMac that changed the equation. “The response to the iMac makes clear that there is a widespread conception that stuff is too complicated and divorced from human concerns,” said Jony. “All the attributes that are emotive have been ignored. It’s about time that changed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were many who accused Apple of cynically designing the iMac to look different just to get attention. Bill Gates, for one, offered, “The one thing Apple’s providing now is leadership in colors. It won’t take long for us to catch up with that, I don’t think.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber210"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber210" class="calibre2">60</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jony countered that the iMac wasn’t designed to look different, but the machine ended up being different as a natural consequence of the design process. “I think a lot of people see design primarily as a means to differentiate their product competitively,” he said. “I really detest that. That is just a corporate agenda, not a customer or people agenda. It is important to understand that our goal wasn’t just to differentiate our product, but to create products that people would love in the future. Differentiation was a consequence of our goal.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber211"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber211" class="calibre2">61</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jobs had made the sudden independence of design possible at Apple. <a id="pageMap_137"></a>“In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer,” Jobs told <em class="calibre3">Fortune</em> shortly after retaking the reins at Apple. “But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber212"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber212" class="calibre2">62</a></sup></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The creation of the iMac also forged a bond between Jobs and Jony that would evolve into one of the most fruitful creative partnerships in the modern era. Between them, they changed Apple’s engineering-driven culture into a design-driven one. “The real strength of the ID team became Steve’s connection with Jony,” said Satzger. “Without Steve being there, the places we [the ID team] were going were just crazy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“In a company that was born to innovate, the risk is in not innovating,” Jony said. “The real risk is to think it is safe to play it safe. Steve has a clear vision of what it is going to take to get back to the company’s roots, what it would take to get at the essence of Apple, what it takes to structure the company to be something that can design and make new things.”<a id="SuperscriptNumber213"></a><sup class="endnote"><a href="part0054.html#EndnoteNumber213" class="calibre2">63</a></sup></p>
