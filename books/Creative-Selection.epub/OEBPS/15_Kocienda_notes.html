[Online]. PBS Home Video, Winton Dupont Films, April 25, 2000. Accessed November 12, 2017. One of my favorite scenes from the documentary showed Don walking across the Netscape campus in the fading light of early evening. A colleague, Tara Hernandez, was along for the the jaunt, and she was toting a hockey stick for reasons unexplained. They were off looking for a wayward software engineer who possessed an arcane bit of knowledge that might fix one of the few remaining bugs preventing Netscape from shipping the browser code. When they found the engineer’s cube, which was stacked high with empty Coca-Cola cans and other detritus, its owner was nowhere to be found. Where was this guy? Nobody knew. A cube neighbor of the not-found engineer, who had seen the engineer earlier in the day, heartily joined in the pronouncement of impending “Doom!” I thought it was a great show, the stuff of Silicon Valley legend. <a href="https://vimeo.com/8235099">https://vimeo.com/8235099</a></p>

Apparently, the author, James Newton, was on the scene when Edison made this statement about inspiration and perspiration. However, the quotation I cite is part of a lengthy back-and-forth with a reporter who was questioning Edison on the occasion of his birthday in 1929, and I doubt the author had a notebook to take down what Edison said. So, did Edison really talk about his working method exactly as we say that he did? I don’t know, but posterity seems to be voting in the affirmative, and by using this quotation again myself, I realize I’m just adding another log onto the fire.</p>

I recognized Liev Schreiber’s voice, and other sources confirm that he did indeed provide narration for the film. In addition, one other clip of Jerry Kramer shows him in the identical setting as a trailer for the film available on HBO’s website. I am reasonably confident this citation is correct. I wish I could watch this HBO film in full. I reviewed a wealth of other Lombardi resources while researching this book, and these few clips from this truncated excerpt are among the best. The review of the film by Richard Sandomir that appeared in the <span class="Rear-Notes-zz4zz-Italic">New York Times</span> on December 10, 2010, under the title “The Loud, and Memorable, Voice of Lombardi,” cites NFL Films as “the main repository for film of Lombardi as a coach.” Presumably, a more determined researcher than I could nail down these clips by approaching HBO or NFL Films.
