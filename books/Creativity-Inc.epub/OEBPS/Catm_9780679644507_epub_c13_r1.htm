<h1 class="subchapter"><strong>NOTES DAY</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="big">W</span>hen I began this book, I hoped to capture some of the thinking that underlies the way we work at Pixar and Disney Animation. I also hoped that by talking with my colleagues, bouncing my theories off of them and reflecting on what we had built, I would clarify my own beliefs about creativity and how it is grown, protected, and sustained. Two years later, I feel like I’ve managed to do these things, but the clarity didn’t come easy. In part, that’s because while I was writing this book, I was also working full-time at Disney and Pixar, and the world did not stand still. Partly, too, clarity was elusive because I don’t believe in simple, prescriptive formulas for success. I wanted this book to acknowledge the complexity that creativity requires. And that meant wading into some murky areas.</p>
<p class="indent">During the period that I worked on this book, Disney continued to evolve rather dramatically, with its Story Trust becoming a candid and supportive feedback system and its production group reaching new levels of technical and storytelling sophistication. <a id="page276"/>Each of Disney’s films had setbacks—which we expected—but we found ways to work our way through them. <em>Frozen</em> opened on the day before Thanksgiving 2013 and, like <em>Tangled</em>, became a worldwide box-office success—a victory made even sweeter because it came on the heels of the studio’s 2012 triumph <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>. The creative culture at Disney Animation, I believe, is fundamentally different than when John and I arrived in 2006.</p>
<p class="indent">As all this was taking place, Pixar released <em>Monsters University</em>, which you may remember underwent a change of directors during its journey to the multiplex. The film—our fourteenth number one movie in a row—grossed $82 million on its opening weekend (making it the second biggest Pixar opening ever) and went on to make more than $740 million worldwide. The mood inside Pixar was jubilant. But as always, my focus was on the challenges ahead and on staying true to our goal of recognizing problems early and engaging them fully.</p>
<p class="indent">I have noted that there are forces at work in any company that are hard to see. At Pixar, those forces—among them the impact of growth and the reverberations of success—had sparked several problems. For example, as we’d grown, we had taken in quite a mixture of people. So in addition to the colleagues who had been with us from the beginning and who understood the principles that guided the company since they’d lived through the events that had forged those principles, we now had more recent arrivals. While some of these people learned quickly, absorbing the ideas that made our company work and becoming new leaders, others were in awe of the place—respectful of our history to the point that they could be hindered by it. Many brought good new ideas with them, but some were reluctant to suggest them. After all, this was the great and mighty Pixar, they thought—who were <em>they</em> to call for change? Some were grateful for the supportive environment—the subsidized cafeteria, the top-of-the-line tools—but others took them for granted, figuring that such perks came with the territory. There were many who loved how successful we’d been, but some <a id="page277"/>didn’t understand the struggle and risk that success had entailed. Why couldn’t we just make things simpler, these people wanted to know?</p>
<p class="indent">In short, Pixar had the kind of diverse problems that any successful company has. But chief among them, to my mind, was that more and more people had begun to feel that it was either not safe or not welcome to offer differing ideas. This hesitancy was difficult to see at first, but when we paid attention, we saw many clues that people were holding back. To me, that meant one thing: We, as leaders, were allowing some faulty ideas to take hold, and that was bad for our culture.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing like a crisis, though, to bring what ails a company to the surface. And now, we had three crises brewing at once: (1) Our production costs were rising and we needed to rein them in; (2) External economic forces were putting pressure on our business; and (3) One of the central tenets of our culture—good ideas can come from anywhere, so everyone must feel empowered to speak up—was faltering. Too many of our people—and to my mind, “too many” is the same as “any”—were self-censoring. That needed to change.</p>
<p class="indent">These three challenges—and our belief that there was no single big idea that would solve them—led us to try something that we hoped would break the logjam and reinvigorate the studio. We called it Notes Day, and I see it as a stellar example of how to set the table for creativity. Managers of creative companies must never forget to ask themselves: “How do we tap the brainpower of our people?” From its genesis to its execution, from the goodwill it engendered to the company-wide changes it set in motion, Notes Day was a success in part because it was based on the idea that fixing things is an ongoing, incremental process. Creative people must accept that challenges never cease, failure can’t be avoided, and “vision” is often an illusion. But they must also feel safe—always—to speak their minds. Notes Day was a reminder that collaboration, determination, and candor never fail to lift us up.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Catm_9780679644507_epub_002_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page278"/><span class="big">I</span> am often asked which Pixar movie makes me the proudest. My answer is that, while I take pride in all our movies, what makes me most proud is how our people respond to crisis. When we have a problem, the leaders of the company don’t say, “What the hell are you guys going to do about it?” Instead there is talk of “our” problem and of what “we” can do to solve it together. My colleagues see themselves as part owners of the company and of the culture, because they are. They are very protective of Pixar. And it was this protective and participatory spirit that led to Notes Day.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 2013, Pixar’s leadership—about thirty-five of us, including our producers and directors—gathered for a two-day off-site at Cavallo Point, a former army base–turned–conference center in Sausalito, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. On the agenda were two pressing issues. The first was the rising cost of making our films; the second was an unfortunate shift in the culture that all of Pixar’s leaders had noticed. As Pixar had grown, it had changed. No surprise there—change happens, and a 1,200-person company (Pixar now) is going to operate differently than one that employs forty-five (Pixar then). But many of us were concerned that with that growth had come an erosion of some of the principles that had made us successful in the past. The situation wasn’t dire—far from it, in fact, as we had some very exciting projects in the works. But as we gathered at Cavallo Point, there was an urgency in the room: Each of the thirty-five men and women there was engaged by the desire to keep Pixar on the right track.</p>
<p class="indent">Tom Porter—our head of production, who also happens to be a pioneer in computer graphics and one of the founders of Pixar—led off the day with an extended analysis of our costs. Distribution methods were changing rapidly, he noted, and so too were the economics of our business. That we were doing well as a company didn’t make us immune to these greater forces, and we all agreed that we needed to stay ahead of trouble by keeping our costs down. At the same time, we did not want to stop taking risks. We wanted <a id="page279"/>always to be a company that would gamble on unusual films such as <em>Up, Ratatouille</em>, and <em>WALL-E</em>. Not every film had to tackle unconventional stories, of course, but we wanted every filmmaker to feel free to propose them.</p>
<p class="indent">These two issues were interconnected. When costs are low, it’s easier to justify taking a risk. Thus, unless we lowered our costs, we would effectively limit the kinds of films that we would be able to make. Moreover, there was another benefit of lowering costs. Cheaper films are made with smaller crews, and everyone agrees that the smaller the crew, the better the working experience. It’s not just that a leaner crew is closer and more collegial; it’s that on a smaller production it’s easier for people to feel that they’ve made an impact. Our first film, <em>Toy Story</em>, was made with our smallest crew, but as each successive film became more visually complex, the head count started to creep up. At the time of the off-site at Cavallo Point, making a Pixar film required, on average, about 22,000 person-weeks, the unit of measurement we commonly use in our budget. We needed to reduce that number by about 10 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">But we needed something else, as well, something that was harder to quantify. Increasingly, we sensed that our people, having enjoyed years of success, were under a great deal of pressure not to fail. Nobody wanted to have worked on the first movie that didn’t open at number one. And the result was a growing temptation to pour too much visual detail into each film—to make it “perfect.” That honorable-sounding desire—we call it “plussing”—was accompanied by a kind of paralyzing anxiety. What if we couldn’t achieve the expected level of excellence? What if we couldn’t break new ground, visually? As a company, our determination to avoid disappointments was also causing us to shy away from risk. The specter of past excellence was sapping us of some of the energy that we’d once used to pursue excellence. In addition to this, many new people had come into the company, people who had not experienced the ups and downs of our previous films. Thus, they had preconceived notions of what it was like to work at a successful <a id="page280"/>company. As at many companies, one of the consequences of wild success is the pernicious distortion of reality. Increasingly we would hear that people had opinions about things they thought were wrong but were unwilling to express them. One of our greatest values—that solutions could come from anyone and that everyone should feel free to weigh in—was slowly being subverted under our watchful eyes. And only we could correct it.</p>
<p class="indent">“Sometimes I think people have gotten too comfortable,” John said when we gathered in a renovated chapel on the resort grounds. “They need to feel excited—to feel like we once did: on fire and buzzing with possibility!”</p>
<p class="indent">This wasn’t the first time John and I had wondered about how Pixar’s people were affected by being at the front of the pack for so long. Would they gradually begin to take success for granted? “There’s a lightness and a speed at Disney that I want to see more of at Pixar,” John said.</p>
<p class="indent">How, we all wondered, could we maintain Pixar’s sense of intensity and playfulness, beating back the creeping conservatism that often accompanies success while also getting leaner and more nimble?</p>
<p class="indent">That’s when Guido Quaroni spoke up. Guido is vice president of our Tools Department, and he spends a lot of time thinking about how to keep his 120 engineers happy. His challenge on that front is real: His department develops technology, but Pixar doesn’t sell technology. It sells stories <em>enabled</em> by technology. Which means that when a Pixar engineer develops a piece of software, it is deemed successful only insomuch as it helps our movies get made. I’ve talked about the problem at Pixar of people questioning how much of each movie’s success can be attributed to them personally. For engineers, that uncertainty can be particularly acute. Guido knows that if he’s not careful, that disconnect can lead to low morale. So to retain the best engineers, he works extra hard to make sure they enjoy their jobs.</p>
<p class="indent">When Guido had the floor, he told a story about something <a id="page281"/>he’d instituted in his department called “personal project days.” Two days a month, he allowed his engineers to work on anything they wanted, using Pixar’s resources to engage with whatever problem or question they found interesting. It didn’t have to be directly applicable to any particular film or address any of production’s needs. If an engineer wanted to see what it was like to light a shot in <em>Brave</em>, for example, he or she could. If a group of engineers wanted to build a prototype using Kinect, Microsoft’s motion-sensing input device, to help animators capture characters’ movements, they could do that, too. Any idea that sparked their curiosity, they were free to pursue.</p>
<p class="indent">“You just give people the time, and they come up with the ideas,” Guido told us. “That’s the beauty of it: It comes from them.”</p>
<p class="indent">Guido had already told me about how, in just four months, personal project days had reenergized his staff. Privately, we’d even begun to brainstorm ideas about how similar efforts could be implemented company-wide. At one point, he’d suggested shutting down Pixar for a week at the end of a movie’s production cycle to talk about what went right, what went wrong, and how to reboot for the next project—a sort of super-postmortem. The idea wasn’t practical, in the end, but it was thought-provoking. Now, as we contemplated how to achieve our goal of cutting costs by 10 percent, Guido had a simple suggestion.</p>
<p class="indent">“Let’s ask Pixar’s people—all of them—for ideas about how to do it,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking at John, I could see his gears begin turning. “Okay, now <em>that’s</em> interesting,” he said. “What if we closed Pixar for the day? Everybody will come to work but all we’ll talk about is how to solve this problem. We dedicate an entire day to it.”</p>
<p class="indent">The room was instantly abuzz. “This is so Pixar,” Andrew said. “Totally unexpected. Yes! You want people to get excited? That’s going to do it.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I asked who in the room would be willing to help organize it, everyone’s hands shot up.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Catm_9780679644507_epub_002_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page282"/><span class="big">I</span> believe that no creative company should ever stop evolving, and this would be our latest attempt to avoid stagnation. We wanted to explore issues big and small—to give candid notes to ourselves about the workings of the company, much like we would give notes on a movie in a Braintrust meeting. So it made sense, as we began to make Guido’s idea a reality, to invoke our shorthand term for candid feedback: <em>notes</em>. At some point, we decided that Monday, March 11, 2013, would be called “Notes Day.”</p>
<p class="indent">The exercise would be fruitless without the buy-in of our people, so we scheduled three town hall–style meetings to explain the idea to more than 300 employees at a time. Tom Porter presented an abbreviated version of his off-site talk to set up the problem, and then John and I laid out the plan. “It’ll be a day in which you tell us how to make Pixar better,” John said. “We’ll do no work that day. No visitors will be allowed. Everyone must attend.”</p>
<p class="indent">“We have a problem,” I said, “and we believe the only people who know what to do about it are you.”</p>
<p class="indent">We appointed Tom to preside over Notes Day and make sure that it was more than merely a feel-good exercise. From the start, he made clear what Notes Day was—and wasn’t. “This is not a call for working faster or doing more overtime or making do with fewer people,” he said in one town hall forum. “This is about making three films every two years with roughly the same number of people we’ve got today. We hope to rely on improvements in technology. We hope that productions can share resources and avoid reinventing the wheel each time. We hope that artists can benefit from greater clarity from the directors.” But to make good on these hopes—and to realize other areas in which we could improve—Pixar’s leaders needed everyone to speak up.</p>
<p class="indent">Tom got together with Guido, Lori McAdams, the vice president of human resources, and producers Katherine Sarafian and Galyn Susman to form the core of the Notes Day Working Group. <a id="page283"/>That group would soon expand, drafting dozens of volunteers for specific assignments. First, it created an electronic suggestion box where Pixar people could submit discussion topics they thought would help us become more innovative and more efficient. Immediately, topic ideas began flooding in, along with suggestions about how to run Notes Day itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The suggestion box, in turn, prompted something that none of us had expected. Many departments, without any prodding, created their own wiki pages and blogs to hash out what they believed the core issues at Pixar really were. Weeks before Notes Day, people were talking among themselves in ways they hadn’t before about how, specifically, to improve workflow and enact positive change. When people asked for guidance on how to be involved, Tom nudged them along, sending this hypothetical prompt to anyone who asked: “The year is 2017. Both of this year’s films were completed in well under 18,500 person-weeks.… What innovations helped these productions meet their budget goals? What are some specific things that we did differently?”</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, four thousand emails poured into the Notes Day suggestion box—containing one thousand separate ideas in all. As Tom and his team read and evaluated them, they were careful not to dismiss the unexpected. “While we discarded the ones that felt like general grumbling, we also made room for interesting ideas that might, but might not, lead somewhere,” he told me. “I am sure we were biased toward ideas that would clearly help us get to 18,500 person-weeks, but there were many topics we picked with only a loose or non-obvious connection to that goal. I’d say our major criterion was, ‘Can you imagine twenty people talking about this topic for an hour?’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Putting like with like, Tom’s team distilled the thousand ideas down to 293 discussion topics. That was still way too many for a single day’s agenda, so a group of senior managers then met and whittled those down to 120 topics, organized into several broad <a id="page284"/>categories such as Training, Environment and Culture; Cross-Show Resource Pooling (we often call our movies “shows”); Tools and Technology; and Workflow.</p>
<p class="indent">The winnowing process was difficult, and it was made even more so by the diversity of the questions posed. Some were valid but highly technical in nature, such as, “Out-of-memory errors related to inadequately pruned sets consume a significant amount of computer and human time. What can be done to improve pruning?” Others were more sociological, as in, “How can we return to a ‘good ideas come from anywhere’ culture?” And then there was my favorite: “How can we get to a <em>12,000</em> person-week movie?” That’s right: 12,000. This was a discussion topic prompted by emails from several people whose reaction to the call for a 10 percent budget cut was, naturally, to ask whether a more drastic cut might be possible as well.</p>
<p class="indent">“Eighteen Five, Smaiteen Five,” said the header on one email received by the Notes Day Working Group. What, this writer asked, if of the three films Pixar made every two years, one of them was produced for a “reduced scope” of 15,000 person-weeks? Or even 12,500? “No skimping on story, just simplifying the rest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Another person emailed: “I, for one, would like to work on a ‘10,000 person-week film.’ I feel that the measures you’d design to enable it would inform efforts to make the 18,500 person-week film.”</p>
<p class="indent">Still another asked: “What kind of film would Pixar make with 12,000 person-weeks? Is there a creative idea that could live up to our reputation but be done for that little? Where would the cuts be? What would be different about the process?” The subject line for that email, by the way, was “GET RADICAL.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once the whittling process was complete, Tom needed to find out roughly how many people were interested in each discussion topic so that he could plan the day accordingly. To that end, the Notes Day Working Group circulated a survey, and what he learned was striking: The number one topic—the one that the most people <a id="page285"/>wanted to talk about—was how to achieve a 12,000 person-week movie. In the end, Tom and his team would arrange seven separate 90-minute sessions on this topic alone. The people who signed up for these sessions weren’t martyrs. The problem of doing more with less was interesting to them, and they wanted to engage with it. (Think about that—the topic that captured my Pixar colleagues’ imagination more than any other was an attempt to be even more aggressive in trying to reduce the budget! They truly understood the problem and its implications. Can you see why I have so much pride in this place?)</p>
<p class="indent">The nitty-gritty of how all this was organized may seem a bit micro to describe here, but it couldn’t have been more vital to the way the day played out. It’s all well and good to gather people to discuss workplace challenges, but it was extremely important that we find a way to turn all that talk into something tangible, usable, valuable.</p>
<p class="indent">How the day was designed, we felt, would be the deciding factor in accomplishing that.</p>
<p class="indent">Tom and his team decided early on that people would determine their own schedules, signing up for only the sessions that interested them. Each of the Notes Day discussion groups would be led by a facilitator recruited from among the company’s production managers. The week before Notes Day, all facilitators attended a training session to help them keep each meeting on track and make sure that everyone—the outgoing, the laid-back, and everyone in between—was heard from. Then, to make sure something concrete emerged, the Working Group designed a set of “exit forms” to be filled out by each session’s participants.</p>
<p class="indent">Red forms were for proposals, blue forms were for brainstorms, and yellow forms were for something we called “best practices”—ideas that were not action items per se but principles about how we should behave as a company. The forms were simple and specific: Each session got its own set, tailored specifically to the topic at hand, that asked a specific question. For example, the session called <a id="page286"/>“Returning to a ‘Good Ideas Come from Anywhere’ Culture,” had blue exit forms topped with this header: <em>Imagine it’s 2017. We’ve broken down barriers so that people feel safe to speak up. Senior employees are open to new processes. What did we do to achieve this success?</em> Underneath that question were boxes in which attendees could pencil in three answers. Then, after they wrote a general description of each idea, they were asked to go a few steps further. What “Benefits to Pixar” would these ideas bring? And what should be the “Next Steps” to make them a reality? Finally, there was space provided to specify “Who is the best audience for this idea?” and “Who should pitch this idea?”</p>
<p class="indent">The goal was meaningful engagement that would lead to action. And while Tom and his team had made room for a variety of topics, there was a consistency to the way they were framed. A best practices session called “Lessons from the Outside” had a yellow exit form that posed the question, “What can we learn from best practices at other companies?” Underneath, it had space for three lessons, each with the same “Benefits to Pixar/Next Steps” follow-up.</p>
<p class="indent">The red exit form for a proposals session called “Helping Directors Understand Costs in Story” gave the session’s attendees a jumping-off point: <em>Introduce the concept of cost early in the story process. Build in scope discussions in the idea-generation phase. Story plays a role in the budget process when building reels</em>. Then, in a space marked “Revised Proposal?” this form encouraged participants to improve on the stated approach. “How does this benefit the studio?” the form asked, and “What are the drawbacks?” At the bottom was another question, “Is This Idea Worth Pursuing?” with two boxes underneath: “YES! &amp; Next Steps” or “NO, because.… ” The yes option asked: “Who’s the best audience for this proposal? (Be specific).” And again there was this: “Who should pitch this proposal?”</p>
<p class="indent">I think you’re getting a sense of how hard our team worked to make sure Notes Day took us where we needed to go. As Tom put <a id="page287"/>it, “We didn’t just want to make lists of cool things we could do. The goal was to identify passionate people who would take ideas forward. We wanted to put people with clever insights in front of Pixar’s executive team.”</p>
<p class="indent">On the Friday before Notes Day, I got an email telling me that 1,059 people had signed up—nearly everyone in the company, given that some employees were on leave or away. The following Monday, we would discuss 106 topics in 171 sessions managed by 138 facilitators in 66 meeting spaces across our three buildings—from offices to conference rooms to common spaces like the Poodle Lounge, which has a painting of George Washington on the wall, a bean bag toss game on the floor, and a disco ball hanging overhead.</p>
<p class="indent">We were as ready as we were ever going to be to let this experiment unfold.</p>
<p class="indent">At 9 <span class="small">A.M</span>. on March 11, everyone gathered in the atrium of the Steve Jobs Building. If the navy blue Pixar sweatshirt I was wearing didn’t make it obvious enough, the look on my face gave it away: I was enormously proud of how our people had already shown their commitment to making Notes Day a historic day for us. I told them as much as I welcomed them, and then I handed the mike to John.</p>
<p class="indent">John often plays the role of inspirer-in-chief, and the people at Disney and Pixar alike rely on his energy and optimism. But this was no rah-rah call to action. Ambling to the front of the stage, John proceeded to deliver the most heartfelt and emotional speech I had ever heard him give. He started by talking about candor, and how we spend a lot of time at Pixar talking about its importance. But candor is hard, both to deliver and to receive. He knew this firsthand, he said, because in preparation for Notes Day, the organizers had shared something else that had come in to the electronic suggestion box: A fair amount of feedback had focused on John himself, and not all of it was positive. In particular, people were upset that—because he was now splitting his time between two studios—they were seeing less of him. The bottom line was that <a id="page288"/>they missed him, but they also felt that there were ways that John could better handle the inordinate pressure he was under.</p>
<p class="indent">John admitted that this hurt; still, he wanted to hear all of the specific criticisms. “So they prepared a list,” he said. “I thought it would be a page. Instead, I got two-and-a-half pages.” Among the things he learned: John was so tightly scheduled, and meetings with him were so precious, that people tended to overprepare to see him, which served no one. In fact, John said, “there were a <em>lot</em> of notes about my time management, and how I carry the emotion of one meeting into the next, making some people ask, ‘Why is he upset at us?’ I didn’t know I was doing any of this, and those two-and-a-half pages were really tough to read. But it was so valuable for me to hear, and I’m already working to correct those things.”</p>
<p class="indent">The atrium was quiet, despite the crowd.</p>
<p class="indent">“So, today, please be honest,” John continued. “And those of you in management positions, be aware that some of this is going to feel like it’s directed at you personally. I’m not kidding. It’s going to happen. But put your tough skin on, and for the sake of Pixar, speak up, and don’t stop the honesty. Trust me. That’s what today is about. It’s about making Pixar better forever, for all of you and for the next generations of Pixarians. This is going to fundamentally change the company for the better. But it starts with you.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was time to go to class.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="big">F</span>or the first hour of Notes Day, everyone at the company headed to their own departmental meeting—Story, Lighting, Shading, Accounting, what have you—where they shared ideas with their closest colleagues about how to be more efficient. These departmental meetings, we felt, would serve as a sort of warm-up for the day; it’s always easier to be candid with people you know than with strangers. But as John had urged, Pixar’s people needed to put their thickest skins and bravest faces on. Because beginning at 10:45 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, when everybody headed to their first session, chances were good <a id="page289"/>that for the rest of the day, no Pixar employee was going to find him- or herself sitting next to any of the people they knew best.</p>
<p class="indent">Why? Because the sessions weren’t organized by job or by department. They were organized by individual interest. During the lead-up to Notes Day, each person had been asked what they wanted to discuss, and Tom’s team had created enough sessions to accommodate everyone. While some topics were so specialized that interest was limited to a narrow subset of employees (for example, to take just one: “What range of solutions do we have for improving Lighting productivity?”), curiosity being what it is, many topics attracted all kinds of people from across the company.</p>
<p class="indent">If you showed up, for instance, to a brainstorming session called “Developing and Appreciating a Great Workplace”—<em>It’s 2017. Nobody at the studio behaves as if they are entitled. How did we accomplish that?</em>—you would have found Pixar’s executive chef, a woman who worked in Legal, a woman from Finance, a veteran animator, a man from Systems, and more than a dozen others. What had attracted such a cross-section? For that particular session, everyone said they picked it because of the word <em>entitled</em> in the descriptor. They’d all encountered people who acted entitled at Pixar—people who insisted on having their own piece of equipment, even if it could be shared, or who groused that they couldn’t bring their dogs to work. “This is a job,” one animator said. “A <em>great</em> job. We are well paid. These people need to wake up.”</p>
<p class="indent">What was most striking to those in attendance at the “Great Workplace” session was how much they had in common. The Systems guy told a story about answering a frantic call for tech support. He rushed over to assess the problem, only to be told by the aggrieved artist that the machine should be fixed during lunch—because that’s when it would be most convenient for her. “I need to eat lunch, too,” he told the group, as everyone nodded their heads. The chef told a similar story about a last-minute request to cater a working lunch that came without any acknowledgement of the hassle (and hustle) it would require of her staff. A character animator <a id="page290"/>lamented that he didn’t know more about what people in other departments, like lighting and shading, did. “It makes it easy to vilify and resent each other,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">One by one, the people in this session hit on the same themes. “We need to make people behave more like peers,” one person said. “I wish more people knew about the whole production pipeline—by which I mean, that they appreciated and understood what other people do,” said another. “We need to heighten people’s awareness of what they do not know.”</p>
<p class="indent">Among the ideas this group put on their exit forms: fostering more empathy between departments through a job-swapping program, establishing a lunch lottery that would match people at random to encourage new connections and friendships, and holding cross-departmental mixers designed to let far-flung colleagues get to know each other over a few beers.</p>
<p class="indent">I chose to describe that session in part because it’s broadly relatable—no matter what business you’re in, you’ve run across the scourge of entitlement. (Were I to describe some other Notes Day sessions—one on centralized rendering, say—I think I’d risk losing a few people.) But regardless of the topic that was being discussed, no matter where you were on campus, you could feel a frisson of energy. If you stepped into a Pixar restroom or stepped outside for some air, you couldn’t avoid overhearing people chatting about how exciting Notes Day was. The feeling was that we were engaged in something that would make a difference.</p>
<p class="indent">Midway through the day, Tom gathered the facilitators to check, briefly, how things were going and to encourage them to share their experiences thus far. At one point, he asked, “How many of you had suggestions in your sessions that could be implemented immediately?” Everybody raised their hands.</p>
<p class="indent">We’d made a decision to separate out Pixar’s executives, directors, and producers from the Notes Day sessions. Partly this was because it was vital that people speak freely, and we weren’t sure they would if we were there. Partly, too, we peeled off because there <a id="page291"/>were particular topics that we needed to consider among ourselves: creative oversight (Are Braintrust sessions as useful as they were ten years ago?), leadership tone and temperament (How can we better foster a culture of inclusiveness in which anyone can suggest a labor-saving idea?), the need to spend money where it can do the most good (We have a system that is vulnerable to excess, that rewards perfectionists and pleasers. How do we manage perfectionism and the desire to innovate?).</p>
<p class="indent">I knew things were going well from the looks on our colleagues’ faces as they hurried from session to session. They were beaming. At day’s end, as the entire company gathered outside for beer, hot dogs, and some instant analysis, I noticed people from different departments continuing the discussions they’d begun inside. The energy on the whole campus was electric. This was the Pixar that they wanted, that we wanted. I made a point of stopping by several bulletin boards we’d erected to encourage people to share their impressions. Among those posted under a variety of categories were:</p>
<p class="indent">Favorite moment from Notes Day: “John Lasseter’s candor.”</p>
<p class="indent">Something new I learned today: “People care; people can change.”</p>
<p class="indent">How many new people did you meet today? “23.”</p>
<p class="indent">And then there was this: “Notes Day is the proof that Pixar cares about people as much as about finances.” And: “Do this again next year.”</p>
<p class="indent">The next morning, I received emails from hundreds of employees. One, from a storyboard artist, perfectly captured the feeling expressed by many. “Hello Ed,” it read. “I just wanted to say a post–Notes Day thank you. The day was truly amazing, inspirational, informative and as I heard many times throughout the day, from many people, cathartic. If there was any cynicism anywhere, I didn’t see it. Coming away from it, I felt as though the company shrank a little. I met new people, got completely new points of view, and learned what other departments struggle with, and succeed with. I don’t know if a metric exists to measure the impact of <a id="page292"/>Notes Day, but from where I was standing, it was huge. In the end, I think we all walked away with a sense of ownership over this amazing place, and its future. A ‘we’re all in this together’ feel. If nothing else, this is a huge victory. John’s openness, and courage to speak about his feedback, set an unbelievable bar. His admission put the entire company firmly behind him, and was one of the finest instances of ‘leading by example’ I can think of. I think we can all learn from that and accept our own introspection/feedback with a similar grace and humility. Thank you so much for creating an environment where this kind of discussion can happen.”</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="big">Y</span>ou’ll remember that the exit forms filled out by Notes Day participants weren’t shy about asking, “Who should pitch this proposal?” That was by design—we wanted the best ideas to be pushed forward, not to languish. So in the weeks after Notes Day, all those who’d volunteered to be “idea advocates” were called in to work with Tom and his team to hone their pitches. Then, they began making them to me, John, and our general manager, Jim Morris—and together, we immediately began moving to implement the ones that made sense.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideas that emerged on Notes Day, in other words, were not gathering dust in a drawer. They were changing Pixar—meaningfully and for the better. The specific procedural changes will sound mundane to anyone who doesn’t work in animation—we implemented a faster, more secure way, to cite a tiny example, of delivering the latest cuts of films to directors—but when you add them all up, they mattered. In the weeks after Notes Day, we implemented four good ideas, committed to five more, and earmarked still a dozen more for continued development. All of them stood to improve either our processes, our culture, or the way Pixar is managed.</p>
<p class="indent">Most importantly, though, we broke the logjam that was getting in the way of candor and making it feel dangerous. Some people <a id="page293"/>might measure the day’s success by charting the concrete results that resulted from it, and in fact, we have paid attention to that too. But real improvement comes from consistent rigor and participation. For this reason, I believe the biggest payoff of Notes Day was that we made it safer for people to say what they thought. Notes Day made it okay to disagree. That and the feeling our people had that they were part of the solution were its biggest contributions.</p>
<p class="indent">What made Notes Day work? To me, it boils down to three factors. First, there was a clear and focused goal. This wasn’t a free-for-all but a wide-ranging discussion (organized around topics suggested not by Human Resources or by Pixar’s executives, but by the company’s employees) aimed at addressing a <em>specific reality:</em> the need to cut our costs by 10 percent. While the discussion topics were allowed—even encouraged—to stray into areas that might seem only vaguely related to this goal, the fact that it was there was key. It provided a framework—and it kept us from falling into confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this was an idea championed by those at the highest levels of the company. Had the enormous task of making Notes Day a reality been shunted off on someone who didn’t have the clout to throw muscle behind it—and not entrusted to Tom, who in turn recruited the most organized people in the company to help him—it would have been an entirely different experience. Employees wouldn’t have bought into the idea because they’d sense that management hadn’t, either. And that would have rendered Notes Day moot.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, and relatedly, Notes Day was led from within. Many companies hire outside consulting firms to organize their all-staff retreats, and I understand why: Doing them well is a monumental, enormously time-consuming undertaking. But that our own people made Notes Day happen was, I believe, key to its success. Not only did they drive the discussion in meaningful ways, but their involvement also paid its own dividends. Seeing themselves engage and cooperate, steering the agenda toward something that could make <a id="page294"/>a real difference, they remembered why they worked at Pixar. Their commitment was contagious. Notes Day wasn’t an end point but a beginning—a way of making room for our employees to step forward and think about their role in our company’s future. I said before that problems are easy to identify, but finding the source of those problems is extraordinarily difficult. Notes brought problems to the surface—but we still had the hard work in front of us. Notes Day didn’t solve anything all by itself. But it shifted our culture—repaired it, even—in ways that will make us better as we go forward.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating: Things change, constantly, as they should. And with change comes the need for adaptation, for fresh thinking, and, sometimes, for even a total reboot—of your project, your department, your division, or your company as a whole. In times of change, we need support—from our families and from our colleagues. I’m reminded here of a letter written by one of our animators, Austin Madison, which I found particularly uplifting.</p>
<p class="indent">“To Whom it May Inspire,” Austin wrote. “I, like many of you artists out there, constantly shift between two states. The first (and far more preferable of the two) is white-hot, ‘in the zone’ seat-of-the-pants, firing on all cylinders creative mode. This is when you lay your pen down and the ideas pour out like wine from a royal chalice! This happens about 3% of the time. The other 97% of the time I am in the frustrated, struggling, office-corner-full-of-crumpled-up-paper mode. The important thing is to slog diligently through this quagmire of discouragement and despair. Put on some audio commentary and listen to the stories of professionals who have been making films for decades going through the same slings and arrows of outrageous production problems. In a word: PERSIST. PERSIST on telling your story. PERSIST on reaching your audience. PERSIST on staying true to your vision.… ”</p>
<p class="indent">I couldn’t have put it any better. My goal has never been to tell people how Pixar and Disney figured it all out but rather to show <a id="page295"/>how we continue to figure it out, every hour of every day. How we persist. The future is not a destination—it is a direction. It is our job, then, to work each day to chart the right course and make corrections when, inevitably, we stray. I already can sense the next crisis coming around the corner. To keep a creative culture vibrant, we must not be afraid of constant uncertainty. We must accept it, just as we accept the weather. Uncertainty and change are life’s constants. And that’s the fun part.</p>
<p class="indent">The truth is, as challenges emerge, mistakes will always be made, and our work is never done. We will always have problems, many of which are hidden from our view; we must work to uncover them and assess our own role in them, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; when we then come across a problem, we must marshal all our energies to solve it. If those assertions sound familiar, that’s because I used them to kick off this book. There’s something else that bears repeating here: Unleashing creativity requires that we loosen the controls, accept risk, trust our colleagues, work to clear the path for them, and pay attention to anything that creates fear. Doing all these things won’t necessarily make the job of managing a creative culture easier. But ease isn’t the goal; excellence is.</p>
