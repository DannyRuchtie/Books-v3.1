<h1 class="subchapter"><strong>THE HIDDEN</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent"><span class="big">I</span>n ancient Greek mythology, Apollo, god of poetry and prophecy, falls in love with the beautiful Cassandra, daughter of the king and queen of Troy, whose tangle of red hair and alabaster skin is famed throughout the land. He woos her by giving her a rare and treasured gift—the ability to see the future—and, in response, she agrees to be his consort. But when she later betrays him and breaks that vow, a furious Apollo curses her with a kiss, breathing words into her mouth that forever take away her powers of persuasion. From that day forward, she is doomed to scream into the wind: No one will believe the truths she speaks, and everyone judges her to be insane. Though Cassandra foresees the coming destruction of Troy—she warns that a Greek army will sneak into the city inside a huge wooden horse—she is unable to prevent the tragedy because no one heeds her warning.</p>
<p class="indent">The story of Cassandra is traditionally taken as a parable about what happens when valid warnings are ignored. But for me, it raises <a id="page168"/>different issues. Why, I always wonder, do we think of <em>Cassandra</em> as the one who’s cursed? The real curse, it seems to me, afflicts everyone else—all of those who are unable to perceive the truth she speaks.</p>
<p class="indent">I spend a lot of time thinking about the limits of perception. In the management context, particularly, it behooves us to ask ourselves constantly: How much are we able to see? And how much is obscured from view? Is there a Cassandra out there we are failing to listen to? In other words, despite our best intentions, are we cursed, too?</p>
<p class="indent">These questions take us to the heart of this book, because the answers are essential to sustaining a creative culture. In the preface, I wondered why the leaders of so many rising Silicon Valley companies made bad decisions, decisions that—even at the time—seemed so obviously wrongheaded. They had management and operational skills; they had grand ambitions; they didn’t think they were making bad decisions, nor did they think they were being arrogant. Yet delusion set in—and as bright as these leaders were, they missed something essential to their continued success. The implication, for me, was that we would inevitably be subject to those same delusions at Pixar unless we came to terms with our own limited ability to see. We had to address what I’ve come to call the Hidden.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1995, when Steve Jobs was trying to convince us that we should go public, one of his key arguments was that we would eventually make a film that failed at the box office, and we needed to be prepared, financially, for that day. Going public would give us the capital to fund our own projects and, thus, to have more say about where we were headed, but it would also give us a buffer that could sustain us through failure. Steve’s feeling was that Pixar’s survival could not depend solely on the performance of each and every movie.</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying logic of his reasoning shook me: We were going to screw up, it was inevitable. And we didn’t know when or how. <a id="page169"/>We had to prepare, then, for an unknown problem—a hidden problem. From that day on, I resolved to bring as many hidden problems as possible to light, a process that would require what might seem like an uncommon commitment to self-assessment. Having a financial cushion would help us recover from failure, and Steve was right to secure one. But the more important goal for me was to try to remain vigilant, to always be on the lookout for signs that we were screwing up—without knowing, of course, when that would occur or how it might come to light.</p>
<p class="indent">When I mention the mistakes that were made at companies such as Silicon Graphics or Toyota, some people cite hubris as the reason. “They started to believe their own B.S.,” they say. “They got complacent.” Others argue that companies go off the rails because of unreasonable growth or profitability expectations, which force them into poor short-term decisions. But I believe the deeper issue is that the leaders of these companies were not attuned to the fact that there were problems they could not see. And because they weren’t aware of these blind spots, they assumed that the problems didn’t exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Which brings us to one of my core management beliefs: If you don’t try to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.</p>
<p class="indent">We all know people we would describe as not being self-aware. Usually we conclude this because they don’t see things about themselves that seem obvious to us—and, just as important, they have no clue that they are missing them. But what about our own awareness? If we accept that what we see and know is inevitably flawed, we must strive to find ways to heighten that awareness—to fill in the gaps, if you will. I, for one, cannot claim a perfectly clear-eyed view, but I do believe that making room in my head for the certainty that, like it or not, some problems will always be hidden from me has made me a better manager.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Catm_9780679644507_epub_002_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page170"/><span class="big">M</span>ost of us are willing to accept that there are fields of expertise we have not mastered. I don’t know how to install plumbing, for example. If you asked me to transplant a kidney, replace a transmission, or argue a case before the Supreme Court, I would of course have to admit that I can’t. We recognize that there are many topics about which we know very little—physics, math, medicine, law—unless we are trained in those fields. But even if it were possible to learn every discipline and master every profession, we’d still have blind spots. That’s because there are other limitations—many of them rooted in the dynamics of human interaction—that keep us from having a clear picture of the world around us.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine a door that, when you swing it open, reveals the universe of all that you do not and cannot know. It’s vast, that universe—far larger than we are even conscious of. But ignorance is not necessarily bliss. This universe of unknown stuff will intrude in our lives and activities, so we have no choice but to deal with it. One of the ways to do that is to try to understand the many reasons why something may be difficult or impossible to see. To gain this understanding requires identifying multiple levels of the unknown, from the trivial to the fundamental.</p>
<p class="indent">The first level of what’s hidden reminds me of when I first became a manager at New York Tech a few months after finishing my graduate studies in 1974. Managing people had never been a goal of mine. If I’m being honest, all I’d wanted, up to that point, was to be one of the guys and do my research. Our group was small and close, bound by a common goal. Since we also socialized with each other, I felt like I had a fairly solid sense of what was going on with each member of the team.</p>
<p class="indent">But over time, as I moved on to Lucasfilm and then to Pixar, the number of people who reported to me grew and then grew some more, and it began to dawn on me that our employees were behaving differently around me. They saw me as an “Important Manager” at an “Important Company,” whereas the colleagues who’d started out with me at New York Tech just saw me as Ed. As my <a id="page171"/>position changed, people became more careful how they spoke and acted in my presence. I don’t think that my actions changed in a way that prompted this; my <em>position</em> did. And what this meant was that things I’d once been privy to became increasingly unavailable to me. Gradually, snarky behavior, grousing, and rudeness disappeared from view—from <em>my</em> view, anyway. I rarely saw bad behavior because people wouldn’t exhibit it in front of me. I was out of a certain loop, and it was essential that I never lose sight of that fact. If I wasn’t careful to be vigilant and self-aware, I might well draw the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p class="indent">The phenomenon I’m describing, rooted so firmly in that primal human drive for self-preservation, probably doesn’t sound surprising: We all know that people bring their best selves to interactions with their bosses and save their lesser moments for their peers, spouses, or therapists. And yet, so many managers aren’t aware of it when it’s happening (perhaps because they enjoy being deferred to). It simply doesn’t occur to them that after they get promoted to a leadership position, no one is going to come out and say, “Now that you are a manager, I can no longer be as candid with you.” Instead, many new leaders assume, wrongly, that their access to information is unchanged. But that is just one example of how hidden-ness affects a manager’s ability to lead.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s go down another layer.</p>
<p class="indent">To what extent do hierarchies and structured environments, which have been designed to help large groups of people work together, contribute to the hiding of information? People often shudder when you talk about hierarchy, as if it is inherently bad; they will use <em>hierarchical</em> as a pejorative, as shorthand for a workplace that puts too much emphasis on rank. This isn’t entirely fair, of course, and I’ve worked in some highly structured, “hierarchical” environments that inspired top-notch work and a healthy interchange between colleagues.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, there are some hierarchal environments that are a nightmare.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page172"/>Here’s what turns a successful hierarchy into one that impedes progress: when too many people begin, subconsciously, to equate their own value and that of others with where they fall in the pecking order. Thus, they focus their energies on managing upward while treating people beneath them on the organizational chart poorly. The people I have seen do this seem to be acting on animal instinct, unaware of what they are doing. This problem is not caused by hierarchy itself but by individual or cultural delusions associated with hierarchy, chiefly those that assign personal worth based on rank. By not thinking about how and why we value people, we can fall into this trap almost by default.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s pause for a moment and look at it from the point of view of a manager who is having someone manage up <em>to</em> them. I’m not talking about brownnosing per se but more subtle forms of flattery. What does that leader see? He or she sees a person who wants to do a good job and who wants to please him or her. What’s not to like about that? How does a manager differentiate between a team player and a person who is merely skilled at telling the boss what he or she wants to hear? A manager might rely on other people to alert him or her to a particular employee’s lack of authenticity, but many are loath to tattle or to sound envious. The leader’s view, then, is obstructed by these people who are skilled at figuring out what the leader wants. When viewed from a single vantage point, a full picture of the dynamics of any group is elusive. While we are all aware of these kinds of behaviors because we see them in others, most of us do not realize that we distort our own view of the world, largely because we think we see more than we actually do.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a third layer of hidden-ness—yet another set of things that I can’t see. The people in the trenches doing the hard day-to-day work of producing our films are engaged in an incredibly complex set of processes, all of which come with their own attendant problems and idiosyncrasies. There are logistical hurdles that must be cleared, scheduling puzzles to be worked out, interpersonal and management concerns. I am probably capable of understanding <a id="page173"/>each of these issues individually if and when they are brought to my attention and explained to me. But the people who are directly involved have the firmest grasp of the problems because they are in the middle of the action and see things that I don’t see. If a crisis is brewing, they will know about it before I do. This would not be a problem if you could always count on people to send up a flare the instant they suspect trouble, but you can’t. Even employees with the purest intentions may be too timid to speak up when they sense trouble. They may feel that it’s too early to involve upper-level managers, or they may assume that we are aware of the breakdowns already. Complex environments are, by definition, too complicated for any one person to grasp fully. Yet many managers, afraid of appearing to not be in control, believe that they have to know everything—or at least act like they do.</p>
<p class="indent">So my colleagues know more than I do about what’s going on in any given department at any given moment. On the other hand, I know more about issues that people working in production do not: schedule requirements, resource conflicts, market problems, or personnel issues that may be difficult or inappropriate to share with everyone. Each of us, then, draws conclusions based on incomplete pictures. It would be wrong for me to assume that my limited view is necessarily better.</p>
<p class="indent">If we can agree that it’s hard, if not impossible, to get a complete picture of what is going on at any given time in any given company, it becomes even harder when you are successful. That’s because success convinces us that we are doing things the right way. There is nothing quite as effective, when it comes to shutting down alternative viewpoints, as being convinced you are right.</p>
<p class="indent">When faced with complexity, it is reassuring to tell ourselves that we can uncover and understand every facet of every problem if we just try hard enough. But that’s a fallacy. The better approach, I believe, is to accept that we <em>can’t</em> understand every facet of a complex environment and to focus, instead, on techniques to deal with combining different viewpoints. If we start with the attitude that <a id="page174"/>different viewpoints are additive rather than competitive, we become more effective because our ideas or decisions are honed and tempered by that discourse. In a healthy, creative culture, the people in the trenches feel free to speak up and bring to light differing views that can help give us clarity.</p>
<p class="indent">Or take this example, which occurred at Pixar during what’s called an “executive check”—a meeting to approve budgets and schedules—on the production of <em>Up</em>. A visual effects producer named Denise Ream was in that meeting, and she spoke up with a fairly radical suggestion: Production would be cheaper and take fewer person-weeks (the measure—the amount of work a single person could accomplish in a week’s time—that we use to calculate budgets) if we did something that sounded completely counter to that goal—delay when the animators started on their work. Denise, who had the benefit of a broader perspective because before joining Pixar she’d worked for years at Industrial Light &amp; Magic, was addressing a reality that she saw more clearly than any of us did: The eagerness to get going, which gave the impression of efficiency, was ultimately counterproductive because animators often had to redo their work as changes were made … which led to animators sitting around, waiting for assignments … which led to increased costs. From her vantage point, it seemed obvious that we would use fewer person-weeks if we gave animators bigger, more fully realized chunks to work on later in the process.</p>
<p class="indent">“I believe that animators will work faster than you’re giving them credit for,” Denise said, “if they have all the pieces they need when they begin.” Boy, was she right. Even with all the usual snafus—endless story adjustments and last minute re-rigging of particular characters<em>—Up</em> was made in fewer person-weeks than we’d originally thought possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Recalling her decision to speak up in that meeting, Denise told me, “They had us delivering the movie at what I felt was an arbitrary early date, and I said, ‘I don’t understand why we’re doing this, because you know we always go to the brick wall. No one <em>ever <a id="page175"/></em>finishes early, so why don’t we just call a spade a spade now, two years before our deadline?’ To me, it seemed clear that you’d want as much time as possible to get the story working. My goal was to push the back end off as long as I could. And it paid off.”</p>
<p class="indent">That couldn’t have happened if the producer of the movie—and the company’s leadership in general—hadn’t been open to a new viewpoint that challenged the status quo. That kind of openness is only possible in a culture that acknowledges its own blind spots. It’s only possible when managers understand that others see problems they don’t—and that they also see solutions.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="big">W</span>e know that there are happy accidents, but there is still another level of hidden-ness that relates to the confluence of events that presage any important happening. Often, some of these events are impossible to see, so we don’t realize how key a role they played. Consider the children who attend Pixar’s day-care program, many of whom are the offspring of couples who met at Pixar. (John and I frequently note with pride the number of Pixar marriages and the many Pixar kids that have come into the world as a result.) Think of all the things that had to happen to make those babies possible. If Pixar had never existed, they would never have been born.</p>
<p class="indent">You can turn back the clock a bit more and say that those babies’ parents might never have met if John didn’t join the production of <em>The Adventures of André and Wally B</em>. or if Walt Disney had never existed or if I hadn’t been lucky enough to study under Ivan Sutherland at the University of Utah. Or turn back to 1957, when I was twelve years old, returning from vacation in Yellowstone Park with my family. My dad was driving our yellow Ford ’57 station wagon, my mom was in the passenger seat and my brothers and sisters and I were piled into the back. We were traveling up a winding canyon road with a steep cliff immediately to our right and no guardrail. Suddenly up ahead, from around a bend, came a car that had drifted into our lane. I remember my mother screaming <a id="page176"/>and my father slamming on the brakes; he couldn’t swerve because the cliff was a few feet to the right. I remember time slowing down and a moment of utter quiet before—bang!—the other car slammed into us, crushing the side of our car. When we finally slid to a stop, the adults got out and started yelling at each other, but I just stood there, staring at the damage to our car. If the other car had veered another two inches into our lane, it would have caught our front bumper, instead of the side, and pushed us right over the cliff. Existential threats like this tend to stay with you. Two more inches—no Pixar.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, many people have close calls like this in the course of their lives, but here is the salient point: As I write this, all of those Pixar couples I am so proud to know have no inkling of the two inches that could have kept them from meeting or their children from being conceived.</p>
<p class="indent">I have heard people say that Pixar’s success was inevitable because of the character of the people who formed it. While character is crucial, I am also certain there were an infinite number of “two-inch” events aside from my own that went our way—events that I have no way of knowing about because they occurred in the lives of other people who were critical to forming Pixar. The full set of possible outcomes at any time is so astonishingly vast that we can’t begin to fathom them, so our brains have to simplify in order for us to function. I don’t sit around thinking about what would have happened if John hadn’t been available to join the production of <em>The Adventures of André and Wally B.</em>, for instance, or if Steve had made good on his desire to sell Pixar to Microsoft. But the truth is, the history of Pixar would have been very different if either of these things had happened. When I say that the fate of any group enterprise, and the individuals within it, are interconnected and interdependent, it may sound trite. But it’s not. What’s more, seeing all of the interdependencies that shape our lives is impossible, no matter how hard or long we look.</p>
<p class="indent">If we don’t acknowledge how much is hidden, we hurt ourselves <a id="page177"/>in the long run. Acknowledging what you can’t see—getting comfortable with the fact that there are a large number of two-inch events occurring right now, out of our sight, that will affect us for better or worse, in myriad ways—helps promote flexibility. You might say I’m an advocate for humility in leaders. But to be truly humble, those leaders must first understand how many of the factors that shape their lives and businesses are—and will always be—out of sight.</p>
<p class="extract"><span class="big">I</span>n thinking about this chapter and about the limits of our perception, a familiar, oft-repeated phrase kept popping into my head: “Hindsight is 20-20.” When we hear it, we normally just nod in agreement—yes, of course—accepting that we can look back on what happened, see it with total clarity, learn from it, and draw the right conclusions.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem is, the phrase is dead wrong. Hindsight is not 20-20. Not even close. Our view of the past, in fact, is hardly clearer than our view of the future. While we know more about a past event than a future one, our understanding of the factors that shaped it is severely limited. Not only that, because we <em>think</em> we see what happened clearly—hindsight being 20-20 and all—we often aren’t open to knowing more. “We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it—and stop there,” as Mark Twain once said, “lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again—and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.” The cat’s hindsight, in other words, distorts her view. The past should be our teacher, not our master.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a kind of symmetry between looking forward and backward, though we seldom think of it that way. We know that in plotting our next move, we are selecting paths into the future, analyzing the best available information and deciding on a route forward. But we are usually not aware that when we look back in time, <a id="page178"/>our penchant for pattern-making leads us to be selective about which memories have meaning. And we do not always make the right selections. We build our story—our model of the past—as best we can. We may seek out other people’s memories and examine our own limited records to come up with a better model. Even then, it is still only a model—not reality.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a class="hlink" href="Catm_9780679644507_epub_c02_r1.htm">chapter 5</a>, I took you into a meeting where the Braintrust was discussing <em>The Untitled Pixar Movie That Takes You Inside the Mind</em>, Pete Docter’s ambitious film that would eventually become known as <em>Inside Out</em>. During the intensive research phase of the film, Pete was surprised to hear from a neuroscientist that only about 40 percent of what we think we “see” comes in through our eyes. “The rest is made up from memory or patterns that we recognize from past experience,” he told me.</p>
<p class="indent">Animators have been trained to be observant—they know that viewers subconsciously register even the most subtle motions and that those, in turn, trigger recognition. If animators want a character to reach for something to their left, they anticipate that a split-second earlier by having the character move ever so subtly to the right. While most people aren’t aware of it, this is what the brain expects to see—it’s a tell, if you will, that signals what’s to come. We can use that tell to guide the audience’s eyes wherever we want them to look. Or conversely, if we want to surprise people, we can leave it out, making the unforeseen motion more startling. In <em>Toy Story 2</em>, for example, when Jessie talks about her fears, she twists one of her braids around her finger. Seeing this little motion, you sense her state of mind, perhaps without even knowing why. The meaning in that simple action is supplied by the audience, though—by their own experiences and emotional intelligence. Most think of animation as the characters just moving around in funny ways while they deliver their lines, but great animators carefully craft the movements that elicit an emotional response, convincing us that these characters have feelings, emotions, intentions.</p>
<p class="indent">This is all based on how we actually function, and it isn’t what <a id="page179"/>we normally assume. Our brain has a difficult job: The actual amount of visual detail in front of us is vast, and our eyes are only able to take in a tiny fraction through that little spot at the back of our eyeball, the fovea. Basically, we either don’t perceive or have to ignore most of what is outside of us. However, we do have to function, so simultaneously, the brain fills in the details we miss. We fill in or make up a great deal more than we think we do. What I’m really talking about here are our mental models, which play a major role in our perception of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The models in our head operate at awesome speed, allowing us to function in real time, picking out what is good or what is threatening in any given scenario. This process is so fast and automatic, in fact, that we don’t notice that it is happening. A snippet of sound or the briefest glance at someone is sufficient to activate these models; a subtle facial twitch can cause us to see that something is troubling a friend; a slight shift in the quality of light tells us that a storm is coming. All we need is a tiny bit of information to make huge leaps of inference based on our models—as I say, we fill it in. We are meaning-making creatures who read other people’s subtle clues just as they read ours.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to understand the implications of how our mental models work is to consider the magician’s sleight of hand. As he or she makes, say, a coin or a playing card disappear, we take delight in being fooled, and our eyes dart about, trying to divine the trick. We can only see a small amount of what is going on as the magician moves his or her hands around, lulling us with distracting patter and extraneous movement. In order for the magic trick to work, two things must occur: First, the magician must divert our eyes from where the hidden action is actually happening; second, our brains must fill in the missing information, combining what we already know with what we are perceiving in that moment. This is a great example of the 40-percent rule that Pete referred to: We aren’t aware that the majority of what we think we see is actually our brain filling in the gaps. The illusion that we have a complete picture <a id="page180"/>is extraordinarily persuasive. However, the magician doesn’t create the illusion—we do. We firmly believe that we are perceiving reality in its totality rather than a sliver of it. In other words, we are aware of the results of our brain’s processing but not the processing itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, people imagine consciousness to be something that is achieved <em>inside</em> our brains. Alva Noe, a professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley who focuses on theories of perception, has suggested another way of thinking about consciousness—as something we do, or enact, or perform in our dynamic involvement with the world around us. Consciousness, in other words, happens within a context. “We spend all our lives embodied, environmentally situated, with others,” he writes. “We are not merely recipients of external influences but are creatures built to receive influences that we ourselves enact; we are dynamically coupled with the world, not separate from it.” He describes money, for example, as something that only has value and meaning as part of a vast interconnected system. Even though our day-to-day interactions with money tend to focus on numbers printed on bits of metal and rectangular pieces of sturdy paper, our mental model of money is far more complicated. That model shapes—and is shaped by—our views of our lifestyle, our concerns about our fair share, our feelings about status, and our judgments of other people and ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">The models we have of our relationships at work, with friends, in our families, and in our society are all even more complicated than our visual models. These constructs—call them personal models—shape what we perceive. But they are each unique to us—no one can see relationships quite the way we do. If only we could remember that! Most of us walk around thinking that our view is best—probably because it is the only one we really know. You’d think the fact that we all have major misunderstandings with people at times—squabbles over what was said or what was meant—would clue us in to the reality that so incredibly much is hidden <a id="page181"/>from us. But, no. We have to learn, over and over again, that the perceptions and experiences of others are vastly different than our own. In a creative environment, those differences can be assets. But when we don’t acknowledge and honor them, they can erode, rather than enrich, our creative work.</p>
<p class="indent">This sounds simple enough—honor the viewpoints of others!—but it can be enormously difficult to put into practice throughout your company. That’s because when humans see things that challenge our mental models, we tend not just to resist them but to ignore them. This has been scientifically proven. The concept of “confirmation bias”—the tendency of people to favor information, true or not, that confirms their preexisting beliefs—was introduced in the 1960s by Peter Wason, a British psychologist. Wason did a famous series of experiments that explored how people give lesser weight to data that contradicts what they think is true. (As if we needed more proof that what’s hidden can make us draw the wrong conclusions.)</p>
<p class="indent">If our mental models are mere approximations of reality, then, the conclusions we draw cannot help but be prone to error. A few words uttered by someone close to us can carry enormous weight, for example, whereas the same words uttered by a stranger won’t resonate at all. At our jobs, we may interpret not being invited to a meeting as a threat to us or to our projects, even when no threat is intended. But because we often don’t see the flaws in our reasoning—or our biases—it’s easy to be deluded while being quite convinced that we are the only sane ones around.</p>
<p class="indent">To show you how easily this kind of delusion takes hold in the workplace, I want to share a story of a mistake we made in the early days of Pixar. We had hired outside writers to help with a film, but we weren’t happy with the result. So we brought in someone else, another writer who ultimately did a terrific job, but we made the mistake of leaving the original writers’ names on the next draft. When the movie came out, we had to give credit to the original, failed writers, due to the rules in the industry that we operate <a id="page182"/>under. Having to give undue credit left a bad taste in the mouths of many at Pixar. We make a big deal out of our belief in giving credit where credit is due.</p>
<p class="indent">Somehow, though, this episode led Pixar’s directors to decide that, going forward, <em>they</em> should write the first drafts of their movies and thus be credited as writers. This belief shaped our model of how we should work as a studio, and this, in turn, affected how several of the directors defined what it meant to be a director. The problem was that these were all wrong conclusions, based on a single bad experience. And that led to more problems. Now, for example, we suddenly found an almost passive-aggressive resistance internally to hiring outside writers at the beginning of our process, even when we declared that we didn’t want directors to write the first draft if they hadn’t written a movie before. What this meant, in some cases, was a lot of wasted time. Not only is writing time-consuming but writers also bring structural thinking to the development process—input that most directors really need. Several projects stalled because directors were underwater, trying to write scripts themselves when they should have been doing other things.</p>
<p class="indent">I think we’re out of the woods now, but it took a while. And all because a flawed mental model, constructed in response to a single event, had taken hold. Once a model of how we should work gets in our head, it is difficult to change.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ve all experienced times when other people see the same event we see but remember it differently. (Typically, we think <em>our</em> view is the correct one.) The differences arise because of the ways our separate mental models shape what we see. I’ll say it again: <em>Our mental models aren’t reality</em>. They are tools, like the models weather forecasters use to predict the weather. But, as we know all too well, sometimes the forecast says rain and, boom, the sun comes out. The tool is not reality.</p>
<p class="indent">The key is knowing the difference.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><a id="page183"/><span class="big">W</span>hen we are making a movie, the movie doesn’t exist yet. We are not uncovering it or discovering it; it’s not as if it resides somewhere and is just waiting to be found. <em>There is no movie</em>. We are making decisions, one by one, to create it. In a fundamental way, the movie is hidden from us. (I refer to this concept as the “Unmade Future,” and I will devote a subsequent chapter to the central role it plays in creativity.) I know this can feel overwhelming. There is a reason that writers talk about the terror of the blank page and painters shudder at the sight of an empty canvas. It’s extremely difficult to create something out of nothing, especially when you consider that much of what you’re trying to realize is hidden, at least at first. There is hope, however. There are things we can do to help ourselves open up and see more clearly.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve talked about my belief that balance is a dynamic activity—by which I mean, one that never ends. I’ve spelled out my reasons for not defaulting to one or another extreme because it feels safer or more stable. Now I am urging you to attempt a similar balancing act when navigating between the known and the unknown. While the allure of safety and predictability is strong, achieving true balance means engaging in activities whose outcomes and payoffs are not yet apparent. The most creative people are willing to work in the shadow of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us return, for a moment, to the metaphor I used earlier in this chapter, that of the door. On one side is everything we see and know—the world as we understand it. On the other side is everything we can’t see and don’t know—unsolved problems, unexpressed emotions, unrealized possibilities so innumerable that imagining them is inconceivable. This side, then, is not an alternate reality but something even harder to fathom: that which has not yet been created.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal is to place one foot on either side of the door—one grounded in what we know, what we are confident about, our areas <a id="page184"/>of expertise, the people and processes we can count on—and the other in the unknown, where things are murky, unseen, or uncreated.</p>
<p class="indent">Many fear this side of the door. We crave stability and certainty, so we keep both feet rooted in what we know, believing that if we repeat ourselves or repeat what is known to work, we will be safe. This feels like a rational view. Just as we know that the rule of law leads to healthier, more productive societies or that practice makes perfect or that the planets orbit the sun, we all need things that we can count on. But no matter how intensely we desire certainty, we should understand that whether because of our limits or randomness or future unknowable confluences of events, something will inevitably come, unbidden, through that door. Some of it will be uplifting and inspiring, and some of it will be disastrous.</p>
<p class="indent">We all know people who eagerly face the unknown; they engage with the seemingly intractable problems of science, engineering, and society; they embrace the complexities of visual or written expression; they are invigorated by uncertainty. That’s because they believe that, through questioning, they can do more than merely look through the door. They can venture across its threshold.</p>
<p class="indent">There are others who venture into the unknown with surprising success but with little understanding of what they have done. Believing in their cleverness, they revel in their brilliance, telling others about the importance of taking risks. But having stumbled into greatness once, they are not eager for another trip into the unknown. That’s because success makes them warier than ever of failure, so they retreat, content to repeat what they have done before. They stay on the side of the known.</p>
<p class="indent">As I discuss the elements of a healthy creative environment, you may have noticed that I have expressly not sought to define the word <em>creativity</em>—and that’s intentional. I don’t do it because it doesn’t seem useful. I believe that we all have the potential to solve problems and express ourselves creatively. What stands in our way <a id="page185"/>are these hidden barriers—the misconceptions and assumptions that impede us without our knowing it. The issue of what is hidden, then, is not just an abstraction to be bandied about as an intellectual exercise. The Hidden—and our acknowledgement of it—is an absolutely essential part of rooting out what impedes our progress: clinging to what works, fearing change, and deluding ourselves about our roles in our own success. Candor, safety, research, self-assessment, and protecting the new are all mechanisms we can use to confront the unknown and to keep the chaos and fear to a minimum. These concepts don’t necessarily make anything easier, but they can help us uncover hidden problems and, thus, enable us to address them. It is to this we now turn in earnest.</p>
