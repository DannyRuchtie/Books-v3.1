<p class="nonindent"><span class="big">W</span>riting a book like this one, which draws on so many years of learning and experience, would not be possible without the input of countless people. I’m going to call out several of them by name, but in truth this book benefited from the work of all of my colleagues and friends at Pixar and Disney. I am grateful to each and every one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">First, I must thank John Lasseter, chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation and my longtime friend. John is open and generous to his core. He contributed many memories and insights. Bob Iger, the chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, supported this project from the beginning and his feedback made it immeasurably better. Alan Horn and Alan Bergman, the chairman and president, respectively, of Walt Disney Studios, have been wise leaders who have worked with me as we have gone through many changes.</p>
<p class="indent">I am lucky to have an incredible team of managers whom I work with every day: at Pixar, general manager Jim Morris and Lori McAdams, vice president of human resources; at Disney Animation, <a id="page322"/>general manager Andrew Millstein and Ann Le Cam, the vice president of both production and human resources. All four are excellent partners who make me smarter.</p>
<p class="indent">This book never would have happened without my agent, Christy Fletcher, and my editor at Random House, Andy Ward. Andy has truly shepherded this project from its inception to its completion. He’s a great editor who made every page more readable, more compelling, and simply better. I must also thank Wendy Tanzillo, my assistant of thirteen years, without whose care and attention my life would veer toward chaos.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve had many, many discussions over the years that have helped me wrestle with some of the more difficult concepts in this book. Among those whose willingness to engage aided me immeasurably are Michael Arndt, Brad Bird, and Bob Peterson. I also benefitted from particularly deep conversations with Phillip Moffitt, president of the Life Balance Institute.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked many people to read this book as it took shape. I approached that process much as we do screenings of our films, figuring that the more notes I got, from the most varied group of people, the better and clearer the book would become. Given the length of this book, I know this was no small favor I was asking, and yet each of these people gave me their time without hesitation. For that, I thank: Jennifer Aaker, Darla Anderson, Brad Bird, Jeannie Catmull, Lindsey Collins, Pete Docter, Bob Friese, Marc Greenberg, Casey Hawkins, Byron Howard, Michael Jennings, Michael Johnson, Jim Kennedy, John Lasseter, Ann Le Cam, Jason Levy, Lawrence Levy, Emily Loose, Lenny Mendonca, Andrew Millstein, Jim Morris, Donna Newbold, Karen Paik, Tom Porter, Kori Rae, Jonas Rivera, Ali Rowghani, Peter Sims, Andy Smith, Andrew Stanton, Galyn Susman, Bob Sutton, Karen Tenkoff, Lee Unkrich, and Jamie Woolf. Robert Baird, Dan Gerson, and Nathan Greno arrived in my office one day with an enormous white board; they were particularly helpful in structuring the book. Moreover, Christine Freeman, Pixar’s archivist, provided enormous research help, Elyse <a id="page323"/>Klaidman and Cory Knox kept many of the pieces moving when I’d lost track of them, and Oren Jacob helped fill in important gaps.</p>
<p class="indent">I should also note that the ideas in this book were developed over a period of forty-five years, and innumerable characters participated in this journey. This is not a history book. While I do provide some chronological narrative to support the concepts I present, I am aware that some people—especially those who do technical work—are underrepresented, largely because describing what they do is complex and less accessible. For the record, then, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Alvy Ray Smith were essential to what I deem Pixar’s greatest triumph—the integration of art and technology—and this book owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, to my wife, Susan, and the seven children circling our lives—Ben, David, Jeannie, Matt, Michael, Miles, and Sean—I thank you for your patience, support, and love. Thanks also go to my ninety-two-year-old father, Earl Catmull, whose memory of my childhood remains clearer than mine, and whose descriptions of my earliest years were invaluable.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><span class="big">T</span>hanks go to my agent, Elyse Cheney, for bringing me this project. To Andy Ward, at Random House, for his all-around brilliance. To my son, Jack Newton, for being his insightful, funny, and inspiring self. To Mary Melton and Jim Nelson, my enormously supportive editors at <em>Los Angeles</em> magazine and <em>GQ</em>, for making it possible for me to take this book on. To everyone at Pixar and Disney Animation who helped nail down key moments, but particularly to Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Christine Freeman, Elyse Klaidman, John Lasseter, Jim Morris, Tom Porter, Andrew Stanton, and Wendy Tanzillo.

The Story of Pixar Animation Studios</em>), <a id="page324"/>David A. Price (<em>The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company</em>), Michael Rubin (<em>Droidmaker: George Lucas and the Digital Revolution</em>), and James B.
